# Client and community ownership

The app opens into Personal space with no joined community. The shell, local
profile editor, Home, Settings and plugin management do not wait for a relay.
`features/communities/service.ts` owns the local identity's default profile,
saved memberships, optional selection and the [known-community sync
state](#known-communities). `features/relay/session.ts` still owns
each community's queries, live subscriptions, projections and durable outbox.

## Try it

Configure `BUZZ_DEV_VIEWER` with your existing Buzz public key in `.env.local`
([setup and safety notes](../README.md#relay-channels)), then run
`just web` and open the Local URL it prints, or use `just desktop` instead. The
development broker runs on macOS and Linux and refuses an OS-store identity
that does not match your explicit public pin.
Click the avatar → **Settings → Profile**. With a community selected in the left
rail, Save updates only your profile in that community; there is no separate
profile-destination selector. In Personal space, Save edits the local default for
new communities without publishing. Use **Add a community** in the left rail and
type a **Relay URL**. There
is no destination dropdown. Accepts `wss://` or `https://` origins, for example
`wss://relay.example.com` or `wss://other.example.com`, and other
Buzz-compatible community relays. No community is pre-joined.

Surrounding whitespace, host case, a final DNS dot, default port 443 and a single
root slash normalize to the same HTTPS origin. Non-default ports are preserved.
Credentials, insecure schemes, non-root paths, query and fragment are rejected,
not silently stripped. Continue starts discovery and authenticated profile reads;
typing does not contact a relay. The canonical origin stays visible before policy
acceptance or profile publication. Failed setup keeps the typed input and current
selection. Reopening the same canonical origin does not duplicate its membership.

An existing readable profile is offered unchanged: **Open community** saves the
membership locally without publishing. New setup shows the relay's join policy,
optional invite code, then a profile prefilled from the local default. Invite
admission uses the relay's policy receipt and signed claim endpoints. Profile
publication uses a signed kind:0 event and requires a matching accepted receipt
and current profile readback before the client saves the completed membership.
Rejected setup retains input and does not replace the currently selected community.
An admitted invite is a remote side effect and is not undone if later profile
setup fails or is cancelled.

Profile editing preserves existing fields that this editor does not expose.
After a confirmed Settings save, the profile also becomes the device-local
default used in Personal space and new-community setup; other existing community
profiles are not changed. Media under the current community's `/media/` path is
not copied into that default:
its previous picture is kept, while public URLs and explicit removal still update
it. First-join seeding follows the same rule. URLs hosted by another community and
URLs entered in Personal space are not classified by this guard; user-supplied HTTPS
URLs are not guaranteed portable. The top-right button and menu show the selected
community's name and avatar through its existing profile/media session. Pending
or unavailable community profiles show an identity fallback, not another
community's avatar. Personal space uses the local default. Merely loading a
community profile does not replace that local default. The first completed community setup seeds
the local default only when it is still empty.
The shared avatar editor supports image upload/drop, HTTPS URLs, emoji artwork
and removal. Done changes the form draft; Save applies it. Uploads use the selected
community's existing media transport. Personal space accepts a public HTTPS URL
without uploading. A protected media URL from one community is not a portable
public avatar for another. Switching communities retires the editor: a save not
yet dispatched is cancelled, while an already dispatched save remains bound to
its original community and cannot alter the next community's draft. Settings Save
re-reads the effective name/picture/description after the accepted receipt; a failed read or
conflicting current profile retains the draft for explicit Save retry instead of
reporting success. This confirmation is not a transaction against other clients.

Use the persistent left community rail to select a saved community or Personal
space. Personal space
clears selection without forgetting memberships. The rail’s Add control opens the
existing join dialog; displaying saved communities reads relay metadata but does not open sessions for them.
Right-click a saved community (or press the ContextMenu key or Shift+F10 on it)
for Mark all as read, Copy community URL, Invite to community, Community
settings and, last, Leave community. Only the selected community can be marked
read, and only while its read state syncs; Invite shows only where the viewer
owns or administers the selected community and this build can mint invites,
with the role read from the relay-signed roster through the selected
community's existing session rather than a further session request. The
Membership settings card applies the same role gate in both development and
native builds. Owners and admins in both builds read the relay-signed member
list, mint invite links, add members directly and change or remove members. Each
change is one NIP-43 command (kind 9030 add, 9031 remove, 9032 role) signed by
the viewer: the broker signs it in development, and the native host signs only
that exact shape and posts it to the relay's `/events`. The relay alone decides
authority; the client offers only the actions its matrix would allow, shows its
listed refusals verbatim and re-reads the roster after an accepted change. Copy,
Community settings and Leave work on inactive communities without opening their
sessions. Leave asks for confirmation, then sends a signed NIP-43 leave request
(kind 28936) to that community's relay before the device forgets it. Three
answers end the membership here. The relay accepting, or answering that the
viewer is not a member, removes the community and clears its drafts, reading
positions and other device state, since the relay holds nothing to go back to.
The relay answering that the viewer is banned also removes the community and
disposes its session, but keeps that device state: the relay still holds the
membership while a ban lasts (bans can be timed or lifted), and the data is
keyed by origin and viewer, so adding the community again by its URL finds it.
That notice says the viewer is currently banned, so the leave was refused, and
promises nothing about how long; it never calls access revoked for good. Any
other refusal or an unreachable relay keeps the membership and reports the
failure so Leave can be tried again. Once the relay has answered, only this
device can still fail: a device record that will not save keeps the community
in the rail and says so, naming the storage error so a store that never saves
is not the same promise every attempt, and leaving it again finishes through
the not-a-member answer; a store that will not clear is logged by name and the
success notice says some saved data remains. A left community that was selected
falls back to Personal space in the service, and the app lands that dropped
selection exactly as clicking Personal space would (Channels, unless ingress
recovery owns the next destination); a community removed from the account on
another device lands the same way, since both go through the one reaction to
the snapshot rather than a callback from the rail. Messages shows an intentional
empty state there. Try drafting in A, switching to B, then returning to A.
Selected channels, drafts and reading offsets are partitioned by the canonical
community origin and viewer; channel IDs alone are not sufficient keys.

## Known communities

The device record also carries what the account service last reported for each
saved destination and the uploads still owed to it, in the same single write as
the memberships, so a join or leave and its upload intent cannot be split by a
failed or interrupted save. Destinations are addressed the way the service
spells them, `wss://host[:port]` with a lowercase host, no default port and no
trailing slash; a configured alias resolves to its origin first and never
leaves the device. Records from before this field existed, or a field this
reader cannot understand, read as empty, and a malformed entry is dropped on
its own, as is anything between a destination's first and last operations.

Each destination has at most two queued operations: a head, which may already
have been sent and is therefore never replaced or re-fenced, and one intent
waiting behind it, which is not sent until the head settles and is replaced by
any newer intent meanwhile. Joining queues an add and leaving a removal; an
intent the latest word on the destination already satisfies (the waiting
intent, the head, or the service's record) queues nothing, so re-running a
join the service already holds bumps no revision. A fresh head fences on the
last known revision, so removing a destination that never reached the service
still uploads revision 0, and adding one again after it was removed elsewhere
carries that removal's revision. An acknowledged upload stores the service's
record and drops the head; the intent waiting behind it is dropped when the
record already satisfies it and otherwise becomes the head on the record's
revision, sent as a fresh edit under its own operation ID. This is what makes
a lost answer safe: the head is replayed as sent, the service answers for what
it wrote, and the newer intent follows, so joining then leaving (or leaving
then rejoining) across a lost acknowledgement converges on the latest intent.
When the service refuses a head because another device's change won, the
service wins: its record is adopted and the refused intent is dropped rather
than re-sent under a newer revision. The contradiction (removed or added
elsewhere) is reported for the memberships to follow only when nothing waits
behind the head; a waiting intent resolves the destination itself. A complete
list from the service adds
destinations saved on another device under their host name without opening a
session, forgets ones removed elsewhere like the banned answer to a leave (no
relay request, device state kept, Personal space when one was selected), and
queues an upload for saved memberships the service has never seen, which is how
a device list from before sync existed reaches the account; the newest intent
for a destination speaks for it in that merge. Joining and leaving never wait
for sync. The `knownCommunities` capability exposes the record, the queue and
these writes to one owner, the bundled Builderlab plugin, and carries that
owner's report back for the rail.

The plugin starts a sync owner only where signing in is possible: the native
app with a configured Builderlab service. The owner syncs only while signed in.
Each sign-in first reads the key the account is bound to: an account bound to
another key, or to none, stops everything until the next sign-in, and the app
never binds the key itself; that is Hosted communities' job. A matching
binding reads the complete list, merges it as above, then uploads heads one at
a time, so a destination never has two in flight and an intent waiting behind
a head is never sent in its place, whether the head is in flight, awaiting a
retry or parked. A newly queued operation, the window coming online or
becoming visible runs the drain again at once. A failed request, or a device
record that would not take the answer, retries the identical operation, under
the same operation ID, at 1, 2, 4… seconds, capped at a minute, so the service
can replay its answer; a timeout, a rate limit and a server error are such
failures. The service's refusals are never retried as sent: an address it
refuses, an account that is full or any other client error (named with its
HTTP status) parks that one operation until the next sign-in while the rest
continue, an account that cannot sync stops until then, and a session the
service has ended signs the plugin out. Signing out or disabling the plugin
abandons the request in flight and leaves the queue intact.

In the native app, the rail checks each saved community with one signed read
after it mounts, for communities it has not yet read when the list changes,
and again for every one when the window comes online. Coming back to the
window re-checks only communities whose last answer was a refusal or an
unreachable relay, so switching apps is not a round trip per community. The
development broker holds lazy, scoped relay connections and has no lighter
route, so the check does not run there. The answer is shown, never acted on:
a relay that refuses this identity or cannot be reached keeps its place, its
hint says so (**Access refused** or **Unreachable**) and its menu explains, so
a community restored from the account whose relay has since removed the viewer
is not silently dropped. Beside **Add a community**, a quiet indicator reads
**Community list not synced** while an upload is queued or the account needs
binding, but only while a sync owner is reporting; without the Builderlab
plugin, a configured service or the native app there is no sync to promise, so
nothing is shown. Its hint names the reason: signing in, the binding, a
refusal, or the retry under way. The indicator and the hints promise nothing
about how long a refusal lasts.

## Session lifetime

Selecting a saved membership lazily acquires its session. Sessions survive page
navigation and switching; startup opens only the selected one. Opened communities
retain their existing per-session query/cache budgets. Arbitrary destinations mean
there is **no longer a two-session maximum**: retained session count grows with
communities opened until app disposal. This slice does not add background eviction
or change in-flight delivery ownership. A failed session remains retryable without
replacing the shell or its siblings.
App disposal closes all owned contexts and their subscriptions.

The `ctx.relay` compatibility reader follows selection. A component captures a
concrete session for reads and commands. Every broker request, including signing,
publishing, media and live traffic, uses that session's destination path. A send
started in A continues in A even after B becomes selected. Connection generations
still fence obsolete work within a session; they are not persistent storage keys.
Channel-head persistence now includes community origin as well as viewer, rather
than relying solely on the relay signing key. In development broker mode signing keys never enter browser
JavaScript; local preferences contain the public viewer ID only. The app-owned
[native identity UI](identity.md) has deliberate import/reveal/copy interactions,
not a plugin key service.

Packaged builds do not include the broker. Native macOS, Windows and Linux
[identity import/create](identity.md) and the shared native relay adapter provide
discovery, admission, leave requests, profile publication, authenticated reads and
supported event writes. Native invite minting and relay-advertised KLIPY GIF search
use the same captured HTTPS community; neither requires the development broker.
Windows/Linux installed-app acceptance remains unverified. Community creation and
background connection eviction are not implemented. Native agent enrollment has
its own [local control contract](agent-control.md). Avatar uploads still require
the development media host. Agents have local
configuration plus separately scoped participation; selecting a community must
not become a deployment or enrollment command.

## Packaged admission and recovery

The native dialog journals an unfinished join before policy/claim dispatch and a
submitted profile before publication. Records are partitioned by public viewer
and canonical HTTPS origin, independent of configured aliases. Existing alias
records normalize to origins when their mapping is available and are persisted
on the next journal write. Unresolved legacy aliases are retained independently:
they do not block other joins or recovery, and become available again after
restoring their original mapping. Records contain only a transaction ID,
destination and optional profile draft, never invite codes, policy receipts or
private keys.
Storage failure blocks the remote operation. Completing a native join requires
successful local membership persistence before clearing its recovery record.

After closing or restarting, open **Add a community** to resume the most recent
unfinished destination. Continue makes a fresh authenticated profile read, with
strong consistency. Successful access resumes profile setup even if the profile
does not exist yet; it never requires reusing an expired invite after admission.
Network failure retains the record for retry. Confirmed access denial returns to
the policy/invite step, where the user can supply a valid code and current consent.
Profile readback avoids repeating a publication whose receipt was lost. An accepted
publication also requires a fresh matching profile read before saving membership
and clearing the journal. Failed reads, missing profiles and superseded writes
retain the submitted draft for explicit retry, including after restart. Late
completions cannot advance an unmounted dialog or a replaced transaction.

Saved memberships are restored through the existing session owner. Uncertain
message delivery stays in the existing endpoint/viewer-scoped IndexedDB outbox,
with no automatic resend on restart. See the [native transport limits](identity.md#packaged-connection).

## Development broker boundary

One parser in `features/communities/destination.ts` serves UI, membership hydration
and broker routing. Optional `BUZZ_COMMUNITY_ALIASES` JSON configuration maps
previously saved short IDs to secure origins; no aliases ship by default. Set the
same alias-to-origin mappings in ignored `.env.local` to reopen memberships that
use short IDs. Unknown but valid aliases are retained in local storage without
being shown or connected; profile edits preserve their saved selection. An explicit
Personal selection or a new join replaces that selection, not the retained membership.
Restore the original configuration and restart to make those memberships available
again. Never remap an existing alias to another community. With no configured alias, new community IDs
are canonical HTTPS origins. Existing origin + viewer storage
keys for drafts, reading state and outbox do not change. Saved aliases and URL
variants deduplicate; malformed saved destinations are ignored independently.

Before contacting a new origin, the client makes a same-origin POST to
`/api/relay/register`. Registration validates and remembers the origin in the
broker process, with **no upstream request, join or signature**. Scoped routes
only resolve registered destinations (configured aliases remain available for
old callers). `BUZZ_RELAY_URL` optionally supplies the unscoped broker destination;
without it unscoped relay operations fail explicitly. `/api/relay/identity` stays
available independently. These settings do not join/select a community or send a
request on startup. Both are public routing values, not credentials; alias mappings
are embedded in the frontend. Restart/rebuild after changing them. Environment
variables override `.env.local`; see `.env.example`. As a separate opt-in,
`BUZZ_DEV_OPEN_RELAY=1` makes a live dev server save and select the canonical
`BUZZ_RELAY_URL` origin for a viewer whose local client record is absent, labeled
with the relay host. Only `1` enables it and it requires `BUZZ_RELAY_URL`; any
saved record, including Personal space, wins; switching in the UI never writes
configuration; production builds ignore it. Session acquisition/retry registers again, including startup of a
saved custom community after broker restart. Query/sign/publish, policy/claim,
owner/admin invite minting and member changes (`invite`, `member`; scoped only,
relay-enforced, used by the bundled `buzz.moderation` plugin), metadata, protected
media and live traffic stay bound to the captured destination.
HTTP authority discovery and other upstream fetches reject redirects.

The broker keeps its loopback Host check, requires exact local Origin on POSTs,
and rejects mismatched Origin or non-same-origin Fetch Metadata on GETs too.
This establishes **trusted-app-origin intent, not a human gesture**; same-origin
plugins and local processes remain trusted, not sandboxed. User-directed HTTPS
networking may reach internal/private destinations. This is not a public-only
network policy or DNS-rebinding defense; TLS verification remains enabled.
This broker integration does not expose private keys to JavaScript or widen CSP.
The separate [native identity adapter](identity.md) deliberately exports keys for
backup; same-origin plugin JavaScript is trusted and can invoke that IPC too.

## Verification

`src/features/communities/service.test.ts` covers no-community initialization,
local profiles, scoped view intent, session retention, selective restoration and
leaving (membership removal, Personal space fallback, session disposal, purged
device state, a leave that keeps device state for the banned answer, the last
community, a purge that leaves named failures, and a native device record that
will not save, which throws before the snapshot, session, record or device state
change), that join and leave each write the membership change and its queued
upload in one record write which a restart restores, applying a server list
(additions under the host name, forgetting without a purge or relay request,
one record write) and a native sync write that will not save.
It also covers that re-running a join the service already holds queues nothing
while a join after a tombstone queues on its revision.
`known-communities.test.ts` covers the queue rules on their own: the head kept
and a newer intent queued behind it, replacement of only the queued intent,
nothing queued when the latest word already agrees, the revision 0 removal
fence and tombstone re-add revision, the head settled with its queued intent
(dropped or rebased), both lost-acknowledgement orders converging on the latest
intent, conflicts with and without a record and their divergences (none while
an intent waits), duplicates settled by destination, every list-merge branch
including the pre-sync migration upload and deference to the newest intent, and
the tolerant reader of saved state including its head-and-last normalisation.
`src/bundled/builderlab/known-communities/client.test.ts` covers the account
service's routes against the native host transport: the exact request shapes,
int64 strings and omitted repeated fields, every named refusal in JSON and in
the framework's plain text, unnamed client errors returned as rejections on
every route while timeouts, rate limits and server errors remain failures,
conflicts with and without a record, malformed records, a 401 that ends the
session and an unreachable service. `sync.test.ts` covers the owner under a
controlled clock: sign-in and a loading record, the binding check that stops
without binding, the complete list merged once per sign-in and an intent queued
while it is in flight, one upload in flight at a time in queue order, identical
retries at each backoff boundary and the reset after a success, a device record
that will not take an answer backing off and replaying, the `online` and
`visibilitychange` triggers, parked and halting refusals including rejections
named by status and the intent that waits behind a parked head, both
lost-acknowledgement orders against the service's own replay rules, the
conflict rule's three outcomes, an abandoned upload on sign-out that keeps the
queue, a session ended by the service and disposal. `index.test.tsx` runs the
real plugin wiring through to the binding and list requests under the
signed-in credential, and that an unconfigured build starts no owner.
`CommunityRail.native.test.tsx` covers the access check (refused and
unreachable communities keep their items with their hints and notes, one read
per saved community per pass, the partial `visibilitychange` re-check and the
full `online` one), and `CommunityRail.test.tsx` the not-synced indicator with
each reason, its absence without an owner's report, its clearing once the queue
drains and its return for an unbound account, and that no check reaches the
broker. It also covers the leave flow end to end against the broker route:
confirm, publish, then remove; cancel; refusals and timeouts that keep the
membership; the not-a-member answers (purging) and the banned answer (keeping
device state); a device record that will not save after the relay answered,
naming the storage error; residual saved data; that the rail selects nothing
itself after a left selection; focus placement; the in-flight state; and that
no inactive session is acquired. `src/app/App.communities.test.tsx` runs the
real app to show a selection dropped by a leave or by a synced removal landing
on Channels while another community going leaves the page alone.
`device-state.test.ts` covers the per-origin purge and its
per-store failure report. The broker and native adapter tests sign the exact
leave shape and pass through only the relay's known refusals.
`broker.test.ts` runs real localhost HTTP with signed fixture events to verify
multi-community routing, profile publication, invite claims, and a captured send
after opening another community. `destination.test.ts` checks normalization,
rejection and the account service's `wss://` address; `broker-url.test.ts` exercises the real middleware with isolated signing
keys and upstream fixtures, including registration, cross-origin guards, all route
sinks and captured sends. Service tests cover arbitrary membership persistence,
selected-only restore, retry registration and equivalent-URL selection. Existing relay tests cover connection generations,
late responses, delivery and revocation.

`native-join.test.tsx` mounts the real dialog, community service and native adapter
with fixture IPC to cover claim/profile response loss, acknowledged but superseded
or missing profiles, read and persistence failures, interrupted setup, alias
recovery, selected-only restart and the completed join's queued upload in its
device record. `join-journal.test.ts` covers alias addition,
removal and unresolved legacy records across restarts. `native-api.test.ts`
and `relay/native.test.ts` cover routing, verification, live auth, capacity,
receipt correlation and expired-event readback. `app/services.test.ts` exercises
native composition, failure/retry and development precedence. Rust tests cover
actual IPC signing, exact-byte HTTP authentication and redirect rejection without
touching Keychain.

One browser case is added, with none removed: `tests/browser/mocked-native-ipc.spec.mjs`
proves page reload and real localStorage/IndexedDB recovery in Chromium and WebKit.
It preserves one identity across an uncertain claim, joins, loses a message
receipt, reloads, then explicitly retries the identical signed message. The IPC
endpoint is mocked by Playwright; it does not establish Keychain consent, a full native
process restart, production TLS, deployed relay interoperability or notarized
release acceptance.

The paired `tests/fixtures/mocked-native-ipc.html` and `.tsx` files mount the real
community dialog, identity/community services and JavaScript native transport
adapter. Playwright supplies the identity, signing and HTTP responses and stubs
WebSocket; browser storage and reload are real. The page requires the test's IPC
endpoint, so it is not a standalone manual diagnostic.

This regression fixture originated in `78d986c0`, independently of the recording
toolkit added in `f68926da` and removed in `0a9ff77f`. It remains automated test
coverage, not a native-app recording. Any retained local recordings from that
removed toolkit used a simulated host; their source revision must be established
from capture metadata, not the gallery's hard-coded revision label.

Regression evidence: restoring the original unfiltered signing payload makes
both browser engines fail at message delivery (`failed` instead of `unknown`),
because the IPC fixture enforces Rust's strict template shape. Restoring the
four-field projection passes the journey.

Run it with:

```sh
bin/pnpm test:browser tests/browser/mocked-native-ipc.spec.mjs --project chromium --project webkit --no-deps
```

Open `/tests/fixtures/communities.html` for a browser-only fixture of the actual dialog.
It intercepts all broker requests and uses a separate fixture identity. Save a
local profile, join using any invite code, and customize the prefilled name. The
first profile publication deliberately fails; retrying should add the membership
while keeping the local name unchanged. No remote membership, profile, or policy
acceptance is created by this fixture. Live validation with an authorized identity can restore existing profiles and
read selected communities without posting test messages. The fixture itself is
not evidence of live access; see [manual fixture setup](contributing.md#manual-browser-fixtures).
