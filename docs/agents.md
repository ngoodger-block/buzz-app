# Agents: current-Buzz compatibility V1

## Scope

This document describes the read-only compatibility/mention slice. The Agents
page also exposes [native local controls](agent-control.md) for create/import,
saved settings, mention-to-add/wake and bundled Start/Stop/Restart. The read-only
compatibility view below remains the browser fallback; native management has its
own handover and rollback contract.

V1 **reuses the current Buzz library and mentions existing agents in channels
and threads**. No migration to relay-only storage. Creation, editing,
add-existing membership, Save/recovery and all runner management are out of V1.

### Implemented compatibility view

- The live development broker (macOS and Linux) and packaged native host read the installed Buzz library at
  `~/Library/Application Support/xyz.block.buzz.app/agents/managed-agents.json`
  (on Linux, `$XDG_DATA_HOME/xyz.block.buzz.app/agents/managed-agents.json`,
  defaulting to `~/.local/share`).
  It does not search/merge the separate `.dev` library, read agent keys from
  Keychain, write the file, run migrations, or call old loaders with side effects.
- Only definition ID/name, identity public key/name/definition link, and optional
  avatar artwork leave the host. Prompts, configuration, credentials and execution receipts are not
  projected. This is local library evidence, **not verified ownership**.
- The library shows one tile per exact identity, grouped only by explicit profile
  links. Each tile discloses its full public key. Profiles with no linked identity
  appear separately; an archived identity does not become an empty profile.
- Only distinct keys with the same displayed name need a short npub suffix. Names
  alone never create a profile group. Suffix collisions extend deterministically using
  the complete inventory, including identities hidden by archive filtering.
- Missing archive evidence keeps identities visible. Archive filtering affects
  display only, never mention permission or runtime control.
- One lazy host read per opening/Refresh; no polling or relay-directory startup
  scan. Concurrent host requests coalesce. Read caps: 8 MiB / 2000 records;
  malformed/missing files fail visibly without echoing their contents. The host
  projects from JSON, so private fields may transiently exist in host memory;
  there is no claim that JavaScript strings are zeroized. Browser reads time out
  at ten seconds and session disposal/cache/access/disconnect fences clear them.
- The compatibility view uses only `session.agentLibrary` and `session.archives`. Unused relay
  ownership/configuration readers and native recovery code have been removed.
- Avatars use saved library artwork, with initials on missing/failed images.
  Optional artwork accepts HTTPS without credentials or bounded raster data URLs,
  never file URLs or SVG data. Relay media uses the existing session media helper;
  CSP is unchanged. No extra profile scan or polling is added.

Source parity pinned at old Buzz `b9392d9d78744df365f9276e1ffe8c1baa5ea903`:
`desktop/src/features/agents/ui/AgentsView.tsx:221–253`,
`lib/catalog.ts:3–12`, `ui/unifiedAgentGroups.ts:16–47`,
`desktop/src-tauri/src/managed_agents/storage.rs:239–283`,
`types.rs:180–209`. Old `load_personas` can update builtins and write back; this
adapter deliberately only reads the persisted post-fold library. It does not
port builtin refresh, live runtime ordering or Teams.

### Ready-to-try workflow / remaining acceptance

Use the public `BUZZ_DEV_VIEWER` pin and `just desktop` from the
README; fixture/default startup cannot show the live local library. No private
keys in environment files. Keep existing Buzz running: this app does not launch
or supervise ACP.

1. Compare Agents with installed Buzz's selected library; Refresh after changing
   that library in Buzz. Stop state should not remove cards. Duplicate display
   names must retain distinct exact keys.
2. In a channel where the agent is already a member, select it from `@`
   suggestions and send a short prompt; confirm the reply from the same key.
3. Repeat in a thread and confirm the reply lands in that thread.

Browser fixtures cover library rendering/retry/session replacement and actual
channel/thread composer publication, **not a live ACP reply**. Manual feedback
reported a working live path, but a separately observed native/ACP trace,
packaged acceptance and the final integration gate remain outstanding. Earlier
envelope/fixture validation does not certify the later compatibility adapter.


## Shared agent selection

`session.agentChoices` is the canonical read-only selection projection. Templates,
mention pickers, the session agent chooser and their admission checks use it—not
`agentLibrary` directly. Its general projection combines ready legacy identities and ready native
identities in this exact community, deduplicated by public key. Templates use its
separate `templates` projection: native identities when native controls exist,
including authoritative empty/loading/error states without legacy fallback;
legacy identities only on hosts without native controls. Template refresh never
waits for an unused legacy inventory. Native process
status is not selection eligibility; stopped/native-only agents remain selectable.
`agentLibrary` remains the old-library compatibility/import source. Agents management
and the shared display-name resolver keep their own distinct presentation contracts.

Do not build another agent inventory in a plugin. Retain the shared projection only
while needed; explicit Refresh retries source failures. Retaining choices preserves
ready evidence across menu remounts. Ordinary mentions subscribe to cached legacy
hints without loading that library; session/template selectors ensure it on demand.
Both use the app-owned native controller's idle-only ensure, not refresh-on-keystroke.
The existing app controller
owns native reads/processes, while the session projection adds no runner, polling,
directory scan or signing authority. Session retirement revokes its candidates.
A failed source contributes no stale candidates; another ready source can remain
usable, with partial failures surfaced through Retry. `status: ready` means usable,
not complete: automatic-recipient inference must honor `complete`, and automatic
saved-template resolution must wait for required pending identity/roster evidence.

Archive visibility has one owner. The projection reads `session.archives` and
exposes `identities` (every known agent, including archived ones, for facts about
existing content) and `selectable` (known-archived agents removed; unknown state
fails open; the viewer is never hidden). Every forward-looking agent chooser uses
`selectable`, including the session agent picker and profile **Add to channel**.
Session admission in `workSessions.addAgents` rejects every known-archived key,
including parent-channel members; unknown archive state keeps the library and
parent-member rules. Selectors demand the lazy archive read through
`useAgentChoices(session, includeLegacy, true)`, and the session picker shows an
archive read failure with Retry. The same base rule,
`archiveHides`, filters mention recipients, channel member invitations and member
addition, and the Agents page and Agent Library. The Agents page keeps one
documented exception: an archived identity with local controls stays listed so it
can still be managed. Do not reimplement the rule per surface.

Agent artwork also has one owner: `createAgentLibrary` publishes snapshots where
an identity without its own avatar shows its linked definition's avatar
(`inheritDefinitionAvatars`). Surfaces read `identity.avatar` and do not repeat
the lookup.

Action policy stays explicit: ordinary member mentions use the channel roster and
hide known-archived identities without requiring verified non-archived evidence.
Ordinary nonmember mentions also offer people from the selected community directory
and eligible managed agents. Send asks before adding them; selection grants no
access. Session invitations retain their existing rules, including legacy choices.
Templates additionally require verified non-archived state (`templateAgentChoices`
returns nothing until archive evidence is ready), and legacy-only choices
need visible community membership. Saved keys are never rebound to a namesake.
Template pickers and agent identity details display npubs, not raw hex keys.
Save-as-template discloses an incomplete inferred
lineup when its required inventory or roster evidence is partial; it never claims a full
channel-membership copy. Shared choice visibility is not permission to grant access.

Regression sources: `features/agents/choices.test.ts` and
`bundled/channel-templates/agent-selection.test.tsx`, plus existing chooser,
composer and session-admission tests. These exercise shared selection and session admission, not native execution.
Native/ACP acceptance and packaged validation remain separate gates; local hook
and hosted CI results are recorded in the pull request.

## Exact channel-member mentions

The shared channel summary now exposes exact members from its existing verified
relay-authored kind-39002 roster, without a second directory or subscription.
The bundled **Mentions** plugin offers **Mention a member** in both channel and
thread composers through the shared conversation tool contract. The host retains
recipient intent, inline editing and avatar removal even when the chooser plugin is disabled.
The picker shows keys alongside names (namesakes remain separate), reads optional
profiles only on demand, and keeps selected identity spans in scoped drafts.
Typing a name alone does not notify anyone. Plain Space after a unique exact name
selects its recipient; ambiguous names require Tab, Enter or click. Editing a
selected span removes its notification intent. Native beforeinput ranges preserve untouched spans; missing
range evidence, IME/history edits and collapsed deletions clear selections rather
than guess. Even a same-text replacement drops the edited identity. Selected mentions appear as inline identity chips in the composer. Namesakes
selected together receive visible key qualifiers; editing a selected span removes
its notification intent. Chips remain available without the Mentions chooser.

### Chooser rules

Both the toolbar picker and inline completion use `mention-candidates.ts` and
`mention-ranking.ts`. Membership permits notification, not a promise that an agent
will accept or answer the prompt. DMs, like channels, can name outside people;
they become references because nobody can be added to a DM. Ordinary
nonmember consent and session invitation rules remain the access owners;
selection itself neither grants access nor starts an agent. Invalid recipient
keys, known-archived identities, and archived/read-only destinations are excluded.
The viewer is never hidden from themself. Unknown archive state does not block
selection. Optional archive reads are lazy.

Search trims and lowercases the query. Members precede nonmembers, with humans and agents in each group. Within each
group, matches against the visible resolved label come first: whole-name exact,
name prefix, whole-word exact, then word prefix. Base names and known aliases are
fallback matches in that same order. Only resolved names and real profile/agent
names are searchable. Public keys (including unnamed identity fallbacks) are not
completion matches. Arbitrary name substrings do not match. A hidden base-name match never
promotes a weaker visible-label match. When visible-label match quality ties,
base-name/alias match quality breaks the tie before recipient preferences.
Among equal matches, agents with profile-reported ownership by the viewer come
first, before humans and other agents. Agents that share a base name then form one
block, placed at the first of their case-insensitive displayed labels (including
disambiguating suffixes). Inside a block, explicit-choice recency, managed status,
and already-known online/away status decide the order. Humans never join a block
and sort first on an equal label. Remaining ties use the displayed label, then the
full key. Each rule is a per-choice sort key, so the order is the same for any
input order. Ownership comes
from profile owner metadata, not a name or presence in the saved library.
Recency stays in memory per session/destination and is bounded to 100 destinations
and 100 recipients each. Neither ownership nor recency overrides membership or
match quality.

An open query installs at most 50 keys. Their order and membership stay fixed until
the query changes or the chooser reopens. Labels, insertion names and availability
remain live. A removed/archived row stays disabled in place; Enter/Tab cannot fall
through to sending. A member who becomes an outside invitation choice also stays
disabled until reopening. Retry refreshes evidence, not the installed order. New
arrivals need a changed query or reopening. Pending sources or missing profiles do
not freeze a premature empty result. Local sources (members and agent choices)
establish the list; the community directory never gates it. Directory people
append below the rows already shown, so a late page never moves a visible row.
While a new query waits or loads, still-matching people from the last settled
page of the same chooser stay visible (one picker, or one inline `@` token; inline
completion remounts per keystroke, so the page is kept per session outside it) and the chooser shows "Searching community…". Uncached queries
reach the network only after a 200 ms typing pause. Settled first pages are cached
per session and query (100 queries); errors are not cached, and Retry reads the
current query again. Identity naming uses eligible candidates plus the
current draft recipients, not every cached profile.

Plain Space selects only a unique exact name/alias/label across the full uncapped
candidate set, and only if that identity is displayed and still eligible. A known
longer name beginning with that name plus a space prevents selection. Partial
names, ambiguous names, modified Space, IME composition, code and protected literal
ranges keep ordinary editing behavior. Selection rechecks available evidence and
stores only `{pubkey, name}`; qualifiers are presentation, not wire data.

The composer rejects already-known archived recipients (never the viewer) at send entry and omits
ineligible agents from the next draft. This is not an archive transaction: archive
changes during enrollment, dispatch or retry are intentionally not covered. The
existing relay membership/send/retry validator is unchanged.

After an accepted send, the next draft starts with the exact selected agent-name
mentions, deduplicated by key. Agent classification uses already-cached profile hints
or the shared agent-choice projection (legacy and native), not a new lookup or
permission grant. Human recipients and
plain typed names are not carried forward. The prefill is an ordinary scoped draft:
channel/thread/account isolation, edits, removal, undo and delivery checks still apply.
**Settings → Messages → Remember mentioned agents** defaults on and is saved on this
device. Turning it off stops future prefills without changing the current draft;
turning it back on does not restore old recipients. Session auto-recipient rules are
unchanged. An outbox rejection preserves the original draft; acceptance is not proof
of relay delivery or agent execution.

Saved teams from Templates & teams are available in both mention choosers. A team
is a shortcut, not a group identity: explicit selection inserts its saved agent
keys as individual mentions in one undoable edit. Names never resolve membership.
Typing a team name or Space alone does not select it. Team names also prevent
Space from accidentally selecting a person with the same name or a prefix.
Each query shows at most 20 matching teams, with up to four cached avatar thumbnails
and a remainder count. Empty, oversized (more than 32 agents), changed or partially
unavailable teams stay disabled; there is no partial expansion. Reopen or change
the query to refresh changed team choices. The resulting draft must fit the existing
32-mention and message-length limits. Selection never adds members: ordinary
channels retain invite-on-send consent, DMs retain reference-only outsiders, and
session admission remains unchanged.

The picker supports Up/Down navigation, Enter selection and Escape dismissal.

`session.messages.send/reply` accepts up to 32 exact notification pubkeys and emits
deduplicated `p` tags. In ordinary channels, Send pauses for selected nonmembers:
**Invite** grants access only with permission and explicit consent, waits
for confirmed membership, then sends notifications. **Do nothing** (or **Send
anyway** without add permission) sends those identities as separate `mention`
reference tags, without adding or notifying them. Close or Escape keeps the draft. Existing member mentions still notify in a
mixed send. Reference keys are validated and bounded to 32. Selection itself never
invites or starts anyone; confirmed outgoing notifications own agent wakeup. See
[local agent controls](agent-control.md#normal-desktop-workflow). DM and session
admission paths remain separate. Current notification-recipient membership is checked at
intent, before signing, and after signing before entering the transport publisher;
retry/restored signed intent uses the same publisher check. Before **each**
mention publication the session performs a bounded foreground finite read of this
channel's kind-39002 roster under the captured relay author. It never joins an
older in-flight read. Empty/failed/malformed evidence blocks dispatch; access,
connection and cache changes fence the read. A newer observed removal beats an
older response. Neither AUTH, route establishment nor the optional metadata-read
status substitutes for this preflight. Failed/capacity-limited live routes can use
the finite evidence while connected. One finite request per mention attempt is a
safety cost, not additional startup work or polling.

A first known local rejection is failed/unsent. Finite membership preparation runs
under the same outbox deadline but outside the dispatch phase: a timeout there is
unsent and starts no confirmation reads. The final synchronous scope/membership
check runs immediately before publisher entry, after all asynchronous preparation.
A blocked retry preserves prior
unknown/accepted delivery evidence and reports its retry error separately; the
first dispatched attempt may already have delivered. These checks are client UX safety,
not a substitute for relay authorization, a membership transaction, or the ACP
listener's own admission rules. Network changes after transport dispatch remain
possible. No ownership or running status is inferred from a member's name/profile.

Wire compatibility is kind 9 + `h` + exact `p` for notifications and `mention`
for reference-only identities; direct replies also carry
`["e", root, "", "reply"]`. Existing buzz-acp owns mention admission, replay,
channel membership, pool wake and harness execution. This slice adds no wake loop,
process launcher, configuration save or agent invitation operation. The local library and archive display are not mention authorization.

Focused coverage: `mentions.test.ts`, `MessageComposer.test.tsx`,
`mention-draft.test.ts`, broker sign/publish integration and the real React journey
`tests/browser/mentions.spec.mjs` and `mention-edit.spec.mjs` (Chromium + WebKit,
fixture identities). `mentions-live.test.ts` exercises the actual subscription →
session → outbox path across reconnect, route failures, stale/failed preflight,
restore, optional name failure and unknown delivery. Live ACP
reply and packaged desktop acceptance are not established by these tests.


## Relay-scoped archive display

`session.archives` is a lazy NIP-IA snapshot capability, independent of
page/plugin lifetime. The dev broker passes `archiveAuthority` only when the
community's NIP-11 advertises a valid explicit `self`; the legacy contact `pubkey`
fallback continues to serve existing reads but cannot authenticate archive state.
The host-supplied signed transport does not yet discover NIP-11 and therefore
leaves this capability unavailable. No secret crosses the browser boundary.

One fresh background read requests kind 13535 from that exact authority, limit 1.
The verified response must contain exactly one empty-content, protected snapshot
within 2 MiB. Missing/failed/malformed/oversized evidence is unknown, never an empty
active list. Invalid `p` keys are ignored and extra `p` elements have no semantics.
A successful snapshot replaces the entire list; newer timestamps / lower-id ties
win. A session-local ordering fence survives cache clear, without retaining old
archive contents; it is not persistent rollback protection across sessions/devices.
Access purge, disconnect, cache clear and disposal clear evidence and cancel work.
No startup request, periodic poll, event-union seeding or history filtering is added.

This is finite evidence, not a live archive directory.
My agents consumes it for display. As in base Buzz, mention autocomplete, the
mention picker and member-add omit archived identities: fail-open while the
snapshot is unknown, never hiding the viewer from themself, and never touching
history or channel membership. `not-archived` means absent from the read snapshot, not online,
owned, authorized or guaranteed current at a later write. Delta processing, native
discovery and packaged/live acceptance remain separate.

The profile pane's **Archive agent / Unarchive agent** actions (base Buzz copy) send
exact 9035/9036 requests (`["-"]`, one `p`, optional `auth`) through dedicated broker
sign/publish routes, never the outbox writer. The render guard and a fresh pre-sign
check accept only the target itself (NIP-IA self request, no `auth`), a verified
NIP-OA owner, or a relay owner/admin in the relay-signed 13534 roster; the relay
re-verifies consent. An owner request copies the target's single live `auth` tag,
verified against the target with `kind=` clauses ignored and `created_at` bounds
checked against the request time. Success requires a fresh 13535 re-read showing
the new state; a publish with an unknown outcome is reconciled by that re-read, and
only a definitive relay rejection skips it. Rows are withheld while state is
unknown; failed checks retry in the background and on window focus, as base Buzz
does, and a mounted profile re-reads after a disconnect or cache reset.

**Delete agent** (base Buzz `delete_managed_agent` copy) is shown only to the
verified NIP-OA owner, for an agent with exactly one native record in this
community. Base Buzz removes the record first and queues the archive in its native
retention store; this app has no such store, so the irreversible step runs last:

1. An exact one-member 9001 (`h`, `p`, `client-id`) goes through the outbox for every
   channel whose relay-signed 39002 roster lists the agent, plus the viewer's loaded
   channels. Each channel's own fresh roster must then omit the agent; a roster the
   viewer cannot read leaves that channel unconfirmed.
2. A fresh archive read runs; unless it already lists the identity, it is archived
   through the request path above and confirmed.
3. `agent_control_delete` (shared with **Agents → My agents**) checks the record
   revision, stops the listener, then deletes this app's saved key before removing
   the record; a key-deletion failure fails the delete and leaves it retryable.
   Deployed remote records, which native refuses, get no Delete action.

Any failure before step 3 leaves the record and Delete in place for retry. Closing
or retargeting the profile admits no new removal, archive or native request; work
already dispatched settles, and a native removal in flight completes without
closing whatever profile is shown next.
Protocol source: old Buzz `b9392d9` `docs/nips/NIP-IA.md`, especially relay identity,
snapshot format and snapshot/delta consistency. Tests use the actual session and
HTTP broker/verified transport, including corrupted signature rejection.

## Current feedback round and deferred validation

Composer: grouped @/emoji controls on the left, icon-only send on the right,
inline recipient mentions and compact avatar suggestions. No placeholder actions,
rich-editor migration or changed notification semantics. Cards use squircle
avatars, short labels and expandable exact keys; no running/ownership badge.

This feedback round passes typecheck, targeted Biome, 118 focused adapter/session/
envelope/composer checks, and the Agents + channel/thread mention journeys in
Chromium and WebKit (4 browser checks). The agent fixture checks loaded artwork
and the exact-key disclosure. Locked Cargo metadata resolves for Apple Silicon
macOS after dependency pruning; no native compilation was run.
Broader scan/native/package checks and independent compatibility-adapter review
remain deferred until an agreed integration batch. Do not gate ordinary visual
feedback on them. Broader agent architecture proposals are outside the V1 scope.


## Raw Agent Activity plugin

**Agent Activity** is an independently toggleable bundled plugin. Compact
avatar/name/status rows sit below messages and above the channel and thread
composers. Hover/focus shows an owner-only summary; click, tap, Enter or Space
opens that exact agent's **channel activity** in the right panel, including work
in other threads. Optional names and avatars reuse shared background profile
queries; key fragments distinguish identities without profiles.

Thread indicators consume the existing kind-20002 typing signal with the resolved
NIP-10 root, not inferred observer turn IDs. The existing per-channel live route
carries it; typing bypasses ordinary history, unread and persistent caches.
Only identities observed on the current live owner-visible feed are
recognized; restored history never establishes typing ownership. Typing before that first frame, or without telemetry publication,
is deliberately omitted; public typing alone does not establish ownership.

Typing expires eight seconds after its signed timestamp (future clock skew is
capped at receipt), swept by the existing one-second activity timer. Messages
clear only the matching agent/channel/thread scope and suppress delayed typing
for two seconds. Disconnect, channel-route failure, disable, access/cache clear
and disposal drop typing evidence. A fresh observer frame does not refresh it.

The sidebar's quiet working dot has two independent sources. The plugin source
is fresh channel observer turns or the channel-scoped typing above, and follows
the plugin's lifecycle. Observer records have no thread identity, so its details
remain explicitly channel-wide.

The display-only source is `session.typing`, not the plugin's typing evidence:
typing by one of the viewer's own agents (the local library) anywhere in the
channel, threads included. Typing remains a working signal when observer telemetry is explicitly disabled. Other people's agents, known only from a
self-declared profile hint, are not shown. This store keeps working with the plugin off, rejects
future timestamps instead of capping them, schedules its own expiry eight
seconds after the signed timestamp and stays quiet for two seconds after the
typer's message. It is display-only evidence, not ownership; while the plugin is
off, the channel popover lists such an agent without a **View activity** action.
A timeline thread summary shows the same dots from this source while one of the
viewer's agents types in that thread; a thread with no replies yet has no summary to mark.
No harness change, new subscription, directory or timer is added.
The development broker loads subscription filters at startup: restart the
existing dev server once to receive typing; frontend HMR alone is insufficient.

A known agent's profile **View activity** action remains available before the
first frame or after a working chip disappears; people's profiles offer none. It
preselects the exact identity and originating channel, not a thread. The
known-agent check is display-only evidence, not an ownership badge, and the action
may show a waiting state for identities with no published owner-visible telemetry.
Shared agents and new activity-view permissions are out of scope.

The **Channel** selector filters raw entries and working-turn counts, or shows all
channels including unscoped records. For a selected channel, batches are projected
as individual matching children, with the original envelope ID retained; displayed
child JSON is reserialized, not claimed byte-identical to the envelope. Unscoped
children are omitted rather than inheriting the enclosing batch's channel. The
all-channels diagnostic retains the exact raw envelope. Raw capture is unchanged.
Channels owns contextual panel placement and closes it on channel/session or
contribution changes; close returns focus to the originating control if retained.

The plugin's activation leases `session.agentActivity` for the live display;
closing the panel does not release that demand. Disabling the plugin clears its
live evidence, but **does not control archive capture**. The shared live connection
carries one dedicated owner (`#p=viewer`) route for demanded observer/metrics kinds,
with no `#h` or history limit. Live activity starts at actual dispatch/retry.
When a kind-demand change replaces a metrics capture route, stored 44200 replay
bridges the admission delay with a 60-second in-flight overlap, capped at four
minutes at dispatch to leave headroom inside the five-minute ingest window. This
replay floor clears at EOSE; later retries are live-only. Ephemeral 24200 cannot
be recovered this way. Settings changes and plugin demand replace that route only
when its combined kind demand changes. While capture is enabled, display-generation
changes keep the wire and capture floor but advance a separate display freshness
floor. Without capture, display resets still renew the live-only route. Neither
lifecycle replaces the socket or chat globals. An uncertain control failure can
reconnect the shared stream through its existing bounded recovery path.

The native identity host and development broker validate signatures, exact tags,
recipient/key, freshness and size before ingest and host-only NIP-44 decryption.
The renderer receives purpose-bound DTOs, not keys or a general decrypt API.
Historical decoding accepts only rows owned by the host archive, not arbitrary
renderer-supplied old envelopes. Native ingestion is **renderer-delivered,
host-validated**, not host-captured: the main renderer owns the relay socket and
supplies fresh envelopes through IPC. The native host does **not** independently
prove relay delivery or that the signer belongs to the viewer. Buggy or malicious
trusted renderer/plugin code can plant plausible history and evict genuine rows
by filling the quota. This deliberately retains the existing
[trusted main-WebView model](identity.md), not a hostile-plugin boundary; moving
the relay connection or isolating plugins is outside this change. The development
broker instead captures only from its own stream and rejects browser ingestion.
Relay admission, not a name, local library entry or successful decryption, is the
ownership authority on the normal delivery path. Saved rows are not ownership proof. These records
never enter ordinary message history, unread reconciliation or channel caches.

Live RAM is limited to 200 envelopes / 2 MiB plaintext and 512 turn states, with
visible trimming. Historical pages do not consume the live-record allowance.
Disable, cache/access reset and session replacement clear live evidence. A batch
with a recognized denied channel is hidden as a whole.

### Host-owned saved activity

SQLite stores original signed, owner-encrypted envelopes, partitioned by normalized
community endpoint and viewer public key. It stores no plaintext, decoded channel
metadata, turn state or private keys; signed metadata (agent/recipient keys and
event timestamps) remains visible on disk. The native database lives under the
app-data directory in `archive/events.sqlite3` (`archive-debug` for debug builds).
The development broker uses `~/.buzz-foundation/dev-archive/events.sqlite3` on the
**broker's machine**, not browser-local storage. Settings show the actual path.

The store implements exactly two owner-scoped policies, both enabled. Unused
`scope`/`value`/`kinds` columns are removed by a transactional v1→v2 migration that
preserves settings, revisions and ciphertext. General subscription matching and
management wait for a caller beyond these two policies; the schema does not claim
that capability:

- **Activity (24200):** 30-day maximum age by default, configurable from 1–90 days
  (Settings offers 1, 7, 30 and 90); 512 MiB of serialized envelopes per
  viewer/community, with a 128 MiB per-agent limit.
- **Turn metrics (44200):** independent capture, 90-day maximum age, 64 MiB per
  viewer/community and 16 MiB per agent. Metrics remain encrypted, unlike classic's
  plaintext metrics archive. No usage dashboard or arbitrary-subscription UI is added.

Quota totals choose the overflow; indexed oldest-first scans stop after enough
bytes are found, rather than rescanning retained history. Oldest records are evicted when byte limits are reached, so retention is a maximum
age, not a promise of a complete 30-day transcript. Budgets are separate for each
account/community and kind, not a physical device-wide disk cap. SQLite indexes,
WAL and other overhead use additional space. Expiry across inactive partitions is
operation-driven and throttled to once a minute, not an OS background purge;
reads also exclude expired rows. Pruning reclaims free pages incrementally and
explicit clear attempts full free-page reclamation after the delete commits.
Newer schema versions are rejected without downgrade.

Reopening/reloading reads 100-row keyset pages through the key-owning host.
Historical decode revalidates signatures, exact tags, recipient and retention age,
without weakening the live five-minute freshness gate. Bad rows are counted and
skipped without trapping pagination. Live records win event-ID deduplication.
Restored rows are display-only: they never create working turns or typing evidence.
Channel-scoped rows need positively known local channel access, including every
recognized batch child. Access changes immediately re-filter retained rows without
rewinding pagination. Unknown/capped/suspended membership hides history rather than
erasing it; positive access can reveal it again. Agent removal and sign-out do not
erase ciphertext; another account cannot open that partition.

**Settings → Agents → Saved agent activity** has independent capture switches,
activity retention and confirmed **Clear activity history** / **Clear turn metrics**
actions for this account/community. Shortening retention requires confirmation.
Turning capture off preserves saved rows. Clear advances a durable revision to
fence stale writes and pending hydration; new traffic can be captured afterward.
Another window's already-decoded display is not synchronously reconciled; reload
it after clearing elsewhere. Developer cache clear also deletes this community's
activity partition and reports deletion failure rather than claiming success.
Storage/decoding errors, including metrics-save failures, are visible and do not
stop live telemetry. An initial native settings-read failure retries at 1/2/4
seconds while settings remain unknown; disposal cancels retries and fences late
responses. After exhaustion, open Settings or reconnect to retry. SQLite waits,
maintenance and paging run off the async thread under only the archive mutex;
the identity lock covers envelope validation/decryption, never storage. Viewer
checks surround storage/decryption. The identity is immutable once ready today;
a future in-process account switch needs a generation fence for admitted writes.
Settings values and their CAS revision are read from one SQLite snapshot. No
old-app import, general relay backfill, export or transcript redesign is included.

Working is fresh per-turn evidence, not process status. Batch children fold
individually; `session_resolved` is activity, while `turn_completed`, `turn_error`
and `agent_panic` end the agent/turn pair even with a null session ID. Silence
beyond 30 seconds or disconnect makes work unknown, not stopped. Terminal state
retains a monotonic evidence timestamp through clock rollback and bounded eviction.
There is no agent-global sequence gate: producer sequences reset, skip and interleave.

### Try with an existing owner account

Use the [README's public-pin/Keychain setup](../README.md#relay-channels) and run
`bin/just web` (or `bin/just desktop`). Open the printed Local URL, choose
the agent's community and open a channel. Keep the existing Buzz runner
active, with telemetry publication enabled on the agent, then give it work. This
activity plugin does not start agents. App-managed agents now default to publishing
on their next normal start; explicit `BUZZ_ACP_RELAY_OBSERVER=false` overrides for
Pi/Goose remain honored. Existing running processes are not restarted by this change. No records may mean publishing
is off, no new traffic, or an interrupted feed—not that an agent is idle.

For a contextual view, click the identity's avatar/mention in the channel, then
**View activity**. It preselects that exact key and channel; **Channel → All channels**
broadens the view. Alternatively, select an active agent above the channel or thread composer.
Expand raw entries and close/reopen the panel. In **Settings → Agents → Saved agent
activity**, verify both capture switches and the host path. Disable the **Agent
Activity** plugin in **Settings → Plugins**, give the agent work, then re-enable:
archive capture should continue independently, and restored rows must not claim
the agent is working. Reload and reopen **View activity**; saved entries should
remain. Use **Load older activity** when another page is available.

Turn **Save agent activity** off, give the agent work and verify live display still
works without retaining that new activity across reload. Turn it back on. Cancel a
retention-shortening confirmation and verify the original value remains. Confirm
**Clear activity history** in Settings, reload, and verify old activity is gone
while metrics remain independently retained. For native acceptance, quit/relaunch
the desktop app as well as reloading its view.

The feed is best-effort telemetry: producers coalesce/batch and may elide oversized
content, and storage budgets can evict rows early. It is not a complete ACP
transcript. Both the development broker and packaged native identity host implement
the archive; no runtime controller, recording export or old transcript renderer is
included.

### Evidence and remaining acceptance

Archive regression coverage lives in `dev/archive.test.mjs`,
`src-tauri/src/archive/tests.rs`, `src/features/archive/client.test.ts`, the
activity/session/native transport tests, and `src/app/ArchiveSettings.test.tsx`.
The real Tauri IPC test exercises command ACL, persisted encrypted rows through two
isolated processes, account/community admission and independent clear. The browser
archive journey uses real broker SQLite and the actual plugin/Settings wiring,
including ciphertext-at-rest, reload without working evidence and confirmed clear.
These are synthetic identities/telemetry. Packaged GUI quit/relaunch, real-relay
agent ownership admission, human acceptance and hosted cross-platform checks remain
separate gates; consult the PR for results tied to its exact head. Historical
validation below predates this archive rework and is not evidence for the new head.

`dev/agent-observer.test.mjs`, `dev/relay-broker-live.test.mjs`, and the activity/live
service tests cover signed/encrypted WS → host decode → SSE → actual session,
route generations, no chat reconciliation, terminal retention and stale controls.
`tests/browser/agent-activity.spec.mjs` covers the actual plugin, raw HTML
nonexecution, keyboard disclosures, agent selection, disable/re-enable and
light/dark layouts at 1280 and 390 pixels in Chromium and WebKit. Live retry and
plugin-launcher regression journeys also pass with the additional observer route.
These automated checks use only ephemeral identities and synthetic upstream
telemetry. The owner reported a successful live activity try on 2026-09-12 before
the mainline merge; this is feedback evidence, not an independently captured trace.

The full `just scan` passed at `1183b2624485dc1e6a12e86cece22eaf7513591c`
after merging main's Markdown and Terminal changes: 35 Node integration tests,
1,054 Vitest tests, 16 plugin-manager Rust tests, 274 Chromium/WebKit browser
checks (including measurements), 14 design-browser checks, 9 native Rust tests,
formatting, types, builds and Clippy. Independent source review found no remaining
merge-integration blocker. Channel-opening fixtures kept optional profiles held;
warm click-to-visible samples were 16.8–19.2ms in Chromium and 50–67ms in WebKit,
with no new head read, below the unchanged 100ms budget. These are local Apple
Silicon fixture measurements, not a live-network SLA.

Packaged/native activity uses the native observer decoder; attended native/package
acceptance and cross-platform CI remain separate from these local results.

### Observed Codex session settings

The Codex agent editor separates **Saved requested settings** from model and
effort independently reported in retained conversation activity. Each row names
its session, turn, worker and observation time and stays explicitly historical;
it does not certify the current launch, saved revision, discovery result or
validation request. Rejected settings, same-turn reported fallback and failed
turns are visible without rendering raw ACP output. Missing or ambiguous evidence
is **Not reported**.

This view projects the existing bounded `agentActivity` records and acquires the
existing display lease only for the exact agent record in the connected
community. It adds no history fetch, cache, poller or transport. The existing
owner-encrypted observer publishes broader activity, including prompts and tool
activity; filtering this settings view does not restrict publication or archive
capture. See [Codex observed session settings](codex-observed-settings.md) for
the acceptance boundary and live runbook.

### Composer-entry feedback rounds

The first channel-only pass added a generic plugin accessory below the composer.
On the uncommitted tree based on `d5877002e2e58a601e1f46dd67697356e665164d`,
TypeScript, changed-file Biome, all 1,121 root Vitest tests and eight focused
Chromium/WebKit activity journeys passed. This is historical feedback evidence,
not validation of the current snapshot.

The 2026-09-16 round moves compact activity rows above both composers, adds
exact-thread typing indicators and a quiet sidebar working dot, and preserves
plugin-owned capture and revoked target-opening callbacks. Multiple turns are
grouped by exact agent key. Stale observer evidence shows status unknown, not
completed; expired typing and ended turns leave the rows. Profile access remains.

On the uncommitted tree based on `a67102aa1201adfa47a03be7d668a62ac748c152`,
TypeScript, changed-file Biome, all 1,128 root Vitest tests (116 files), and all ten
Chromium/WebKit activity journeys passed. The Chromium cold/warm channel-opening
check also passed. Browser coverage includes exact-thread/sibling/channel
isolation, sidebar semantics, channel-detail navigation, above-composer geometry,
and light/dark 1280/390px layouts. Screenshots were inspected. Independent
changed-path source review found no ownership, routing or lifecycle blocker;
the subsequent future-timestamp expiry cap has a passing regression test.

Wes reported the live local workflow working and approved the tightened layout
on 2026-09-18. Activity rows are borderless, avatars align with the composer's
left edge, and the last row sits 4px above it. Working dots gently pulse unless
reduced motion is requested; unknown status remains static. Browser regressions
cover these presentation contracts in both engines.

The 2026-09-18 integration incorporates main `125b5ca` while retaining its rich
composer, routed-thread navigation, sidebar activity popover and public typing
indicator. Public typing and owner-only activity remain independent projections;
an owner's typing agent can appear in both. The receive path rechecks session
access/generation after shared typing subscribers run, before admitting activity.

On `65213eb` plus the resolved main integration, all 1,576 Vitest tests (150 files)
passed. Both engines passed the shared typing/layout cases (22), then the activity,
Buzz-link and thread-history cases (20) after fixing internal activity targets
being swallowed by the broader `buzz:` navigation classifier. Existing activity
cases failed before that fix in both engines. Accessory lifetime coverage now
mounts real React in StrictMode rather than mocking hooks.

These are targeted integration checks, not a completed `just scan`. The earlier
scan was interrupted during browser tests; broader hosted CI, DCO and required
review remain separate gates. Packaged native activity now uses purpose-bound
observer decoding; attended packaged and live-relay acceptance remain outstanding.

### Shared identity names

Distinct agent keys with the same displayed name receive a short npub suffix,
regardless of their profile links. Names are compared after trimming outer
whitespace, with case preserved. Directory qualifiers use a middle-dot separator
(`Honey · 2abc`). Unique displayed names have no suffix. These display labels are
not serialized into mentions. The composer retains its existing inline-chip
qualifiers for selected namesakes, independently of live directory labels. Collision
checks include hidden library identities and ready native identities in the
current community, using the same native/inventory/public-profile precedence.
Name edits update the suffixes; they never merge identities or profile groups.

The Agents plugin supplies display names through the app-owned identity-name
service. Each relay session binds its own view. A ready native record takes
precedence only in its matching community; otherwise the ready legacy display
inventory supplies the name, then the public profile. Plugin disable restores
public-profile names. These labels never change identity keys, membership,
credentials, or runtime admission. Profile panels, messages, mention choices,
activity, conversation labels and new notifications consume this view. Mention
parsing still uses signed identity evidence before resolving its visible label.

### Additive community inventory

The active session reads the owner's kind-30175 profiles and kind-30177 identities
from its accessible relay. It also retains the local library reader. The inventory
joins exact public keys, not equal names; explicit profile references use the
publisher's slug mapping only when local definitions do not collide. Local names
and artwork win for matching keys. Native configuration still wins within its
matching community. A failed source leaves the other source visible with a warning.

Discovery is not global coverage, verified membership, credentials, or execution
status. Native cards keep their controls. Other known identities appear in a
read-only section. Each card offers its own Import; the separate installation
browser appears only for repair.
No keys, config, memory, membership, or runtime state are changed by discovery.
