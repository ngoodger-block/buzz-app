# Local agent controls

The Agents page uses one app-owned native controller for creating, importing,
editing and running local agents. Inventory cards join records by exact public key;
managed actions remain keyed by native identity/community record. Browser-only access keeps the read-only old library; it cannot run
agents. The only product entry point is ordinary desktop startup.

## Normal desktop workflow

Run from the feature worktree with `bin/just desktop`, not a management-only
launcher. The command prepares the pinned agent runtime before starting Tauri;
the first build may take several minutes. Later launches verify and reuse matching
resources, rebuilding missing, stale or corrupt ones. Preparation failure stops
launch rather than opening a desktop that cannot run agents. This opens **Buzz Foundation** using the ordinary live-development
configuration and persistent native settings. Coordinate the native rebuild/relaunch;
quit other Foundation copies first. Saved enabled agents can restore on startup.
Keep imported agents disabled and old Buzz running until an attended handover.

Open **Agents** for discovered and imported identities grouped by known community
associations. Each identity card keeps the configured destinations’ **Start / Stop**
controls. **Edit**, **Duplicate**, and **Delete** are in the card’s three-dot menu.
Duplicate seeds Create with editable settings and a fresh identity; write-only
environment values require re-entry. Delete stops the local process and removes
this app's settings and Keychain key after confirmation. The key remains while
another setup of the same identity still uses it. Delete does not archive the
relay identity or erase messages. Deployed remote records are refused. Actions
use native ID/revision, never the display name. Older hosts without parked
inventory retain the **My agents** and read-only library sections. Managed
controls remain available when discovery is disconnected, unavailable or archived.

**Add agent** shares the Edit fields and model browser. In the development desktop,
Create generates a native key, obtains the captured viewer's owner authorization,
saves the agent, starts it, then publishes its profile. A failed Start or profile
publication retains the saved identity and offers a retry for that step; it never
creates another identity. A native Start response can confirm a saved agent while
reporting that its process could not run. During Create, Start, or profile setup,
**Close** leaves the operation running and exposes the existing cards' recovery
Stop. Late completion never closes a subsequently opened dialog. If an operation
cannot be confirmed, refresh status before repeating it.

Create is blocked with an explanation if this app’s runtime is unavailable;
existing agents and profile retry remain intact.
Without the dev broker, the native identity signs the owner authorization only
for the key this host prepared for the pending Create. Native owner-scoped
community resolution is also available; other broker-only helpers remain
unavailable. Packaged support still requires attended native acceptance.

New agents, including clones and duplicates, start with `BUZZ_ACP_AGENTS=10` in
the existing **Environment** overrides. Replace or remove it there to choose the
worker count. With **Each thread** conversation context, separate threads can
use different workers while retaining separate histories. Existing saved agents
keep their settings; add the variable and restart them to enable more workers.

Pi and Goose apply permitted Environment overrides after saved fields and
imported settings. For example, `BUZZ_ACP_MODEL`, `BUZZ_ACP_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, and
`BUZZ_ACP_AGENTS` take precedence at launch; worker counts must be from 1 to 32.
Removing an override restores the saved/default setting. Identity keys, the relay
URL, executable commands, saved response policy, and team instructions remain
protected, along with specific host controls: session policy, presence, inactivity
exit, idle-pool sleep, setup payload, and replay floor. Pi and Goose still permit
subscription, relay observer, deduplication, and event-handling overrides, as old
Buzz did. Device-wide overrides are inherited only by harnesses that permit them;
`BUZZ_ACP_MODEL` also requires the same default harness. Buzz Agent keeps its key
restrictions; its worker override takes precedence over imported parallelism.
Pi model browsing and connection tests use the
Provider/Model fields; ACP overrides apply to the listener's sessions at launch.

**Hermes Agent** is an externally installed ACP harness. Settings → Agents →
Harnesses → **Add harness** shows executable availability and a manual setup
guide; **Check again** refreshes discovery. Buzz uses `hermes-acp` with no default arguments and does not
install Hermes or manage its provider credentials. Configure its default model
and sign-in with `hermes model` in your terminal. The agent form uses those
defaults and offers no Provider, Browse models or Test connection controls for
Hermes yet. Existing model/provider values remain visible for recovery: select
**Use Hermes Agent defaults**, then Save, before starting. Native launch rejects those
selectors, and Hermes does not permit `BUZZ_ACP_MODEL` environment overrides.
Saved executable paths survive detection refresh; choose the newly discovered
Hermes option explicitly to replace an old path. Device defaults and old-agent
import do not offer Hermes in this slice.

**Clone to this community** opens the existing creation dialog with only the old
agent’s name and resolved instructions. Review that text for embedded secrets.
Runtime settings and workspace use this app’s defaults and remain editable.
Clone generates a new native identity; it does not copy identity keys, environment
values, command arguments, paths, history or membership. Saving leaves the new
agent stopped. The source is read-only and no legacy credential access occurs.

**Import** preserves the selected old-installation identity and private key. It
requires an explicit destination and a fresh source/destination-bound preview.
Successful import saves a configured, stopped setup. It does not start a listener,
invite an agent, or modify the source installation. An identity already held
locally cannot be imported again into another community; use **Clone** instead.
The native prepare and commit boundaries both enforce that exact-key rule.

The unified inventory offers Import only under **Available to import**, once per
exact public key. Multiple old installations require an explicit source choice.
The selected row opens the import review. Without a selected community, such
as in Personal space, the review asks for the destination before it loads a
fresh preview. Each startup reads every old installation again: an identity
deleted from all of them, or whose installation is removed, leaves the list. A
damaged source keeps its previous entries. Source read failures remain visible.
Older hosts retain the separate installation browser as a compatibility path.

**Use here** is recovery for older incomplete local imports, not a normal next
step after Import. It retains the identity/key, requires owner-authorized community
confirmation, and leaves the recovered setup stopped with app-launch start off.
The development broker and the packaged desktop app both provide that
confirmation; the desktop app signs it natively (`relay_agent_resolve`). Native
code refuses a new
community when that identity already has a configured setup elsewhere. A retry
for the already recovered destination is harmless. Existing historical setups
remain visible and controllable; this rule does not move or delete them.

Local team-linked imports snapshot the deployment team's instructions from the
chosen library's `agents/teams.json`, alongside the resolved persona prompt.
The existing ACP team-instructions input receives that snapshot; later edits in
old Buzz are not synchronized. As in old Buzz, a deleted team or a directory-only
legacy binding without a deployment team ID contributes no team instructions.
Remote backends and relay mesh remain unsupported.

Older imports missing this snapshot show **Import or repair from old Buzz**.
Choose their original source library and destination, then **Repair team import**.
This adds only the missing team instructions and advances the saved revision;
it preserves the identity, credentials, prompt, model, environment and enabled
intent, and never starts/restarts an agent. Source changes or changed saved
settings reject the repair. No Keychain read is needed for repair. Before Start,
perform the same attended old-Buzz handover as for a fresh import.

To use an agent, open a channel and select it from **@ mentions**. Both mention
menus include the selected community’s people directory alongside channel members
and configured managed agents. Directory reads are bounded; narrow the search for more people.
A nonmember is labeled **Not in channel · Choose whether to add when you send**.
Selection alone does nothing. Send asks, as block/buzz desktop does: **Invite**
or **Do nothing**. Without add permission, the only action is **Send anyway**.
Invite uses the existing durable member-add operation and confirms membership
before addressed delivery. It does not start an agent before the outgoing message.
Do nothing and Send anyway send nonmembers as reference mentions, without granting
access or notifying them; channel-member mentions remain addressed. Close or
Escape keeps the draft.
Failed additions keep the draft and allow retry of the same pending operation.
A definitively failed addition older than 15 minutes must be dismissed in Outbox
before a new add; unknown outcomes are never silently replaced. Channel, thread,
and forum-channel composers share this behavior. DM participants and session
admission rules are unchanged.

Once an identity is configured by Import or legacy **Use here** recovery, a confirmed outgoing channel or thread mention starts that exact local
agent (public key + community), without a separate Start click. Import itself
remains non-starting. Stop cancels earlier pending mention wakes and active work;
a later deliberate mention can start the agent again. Plain name text without
recipient selection, received history and unconfirmed sends do not start agents.
Start failures appear separately as “Message sent, but…”; do not resend merely
because execution failed. The old-Buzz ownership guard remains in force.

Mention startup carries the earliest relevant pending send timestamp into the
bundled runner's existing replay input (bounded by its 15-minute catch-up limit).
Already-running agents are not restarted. Mentions during queued or pending startup
attach their earliest timestamp to that same launch, without another credential
read or listener. Stop and changed saved revisions retire that input. If launch
has already finished or the host cannot attach it, the send shows a separate
replay warning instead of silently treating Waiting as Running. Attachment is not
proof of delivery; a later credential/launch failure remains visible in Agents.
Process state is not proof of a live reply; imported identities require old Buzz
stopped before handover.

The focused Add/Edit dialog contains Name and Agent instructions, followed by
**AI configuration** in dependency order: **Harness → Provider → Model**. Provider
choices come from the selected harness; model discovery uses the current draft.
Existing/custom values remain intact when another field changes. Workspace,
arguments and write-only environment patches remain under **Advanced**;
Start/Stop/Restart and exact identity are under **Runtime and identity**. Save uses
native ID/revision and restarts the agent only if it is running and its effective
settings changed (see [saving](#global-agent-defaults-and-saving)). Dirty
drafts resist backdrop/Escape; explicit Cancel/Close discards. Page
navigation/reload still discards page-local drafts.

**Browse models** requests the current Databricks catalog on explicit button
activation, including when typing has already opened the local popup. Typing,
focus and ArrowDown navigation never start a model-host request. Existing
app-isolated credentials are used/refreshed first; only an authentication failure
can open browser sign-in. No separate Connect button is required. Errors/cancellation
need explicit Retry; Refresh in **Advanced model settings** stays headless.
Choose a result or enter a custom ID (blank is allowed); Enter or leaving the field
commits typed text, Escape abandons the query. Save, close and reopen to check it.
If no workspace is configured, edit the agent and set **Databricks workspace (HTTPS origin)**
under **Advanced → Model**. App maintainers can instead supply the nonsecret
`DATABRICKS_HOST` build default below and rebuild the app.

### Nonsecret build defaults

Native builds read these inputs from the repository-root, ignored `.env.local`,
or from the build process environment. A process value wins **by presence**,
including an empty value. Both `just desktop` and release Cargo/Tauri builds use
the same controller-owned configuration. For example:

```dotenv
BUZZ_BUILD_BUZZ_AGENT_PROVIDER=databricks_v2
BUZZ_BUILD_AGENT_ENV='DATABRICKS_HOST=https://workspace.example.com
DATABRICKS_MODEL=your-model-id
DATABRICKS_MODEL_FILTER=team-*'
# Optional capability: any present value, even empty/0/false, enables it.
BUZZ_BUILD_AGENT_ACCESS_OWNER_ONLY=1
```

`BUZZ_BUILD_AGENT_ENV` is multiline `KEY=value` content, not a file path. Only
`DATABRICKS_HOST`, `DATABRICKS_MODEL` and `DATABRICKS_MODEL_FILTER` are accepted;
tokens, unknown/duplicate keys and malformed HTTPS origins fail the build without
echoing values. These are **public, nonsecret defaults** compiled into the binary
and available in the native editor snapshot. Never put credentials here. No
organization-specific host, provider or model is supplied by the app.

- Blank saved provider/model selectors inherit the build floor for `buzz-agent`
  only (including its absolute executable path); other harnesses do not. Saved
  selectors win over the floor, and saved `BUZZ_AGENT_PROVIDER`/`BUZZ_AGENT_MODEL`
  environment overrides win over selectors, including explicit empty strings.
  `DATABRICKS_MODEL` is a provider fallback below an explicit Model selector.
- An absent saved Databricks pair inherits the build host/filter; an explicit
  pair, including blanks, wins. Saved `DATABRICKS_HOST`/`DATABRICKS_MODEL_FILTER`
  environment overrides win over either. The same resolution supplies model
  discovery, credential requests and worker startup. Untouched Create or
  name-only Edit/Save never copies build defaults into storage. Editing either
  workspace/filter field intentionally saves **both displayed values**.
- Presence of `BUZZ_BUILD_AGENT_ACCESS_OWNER_ONLY` clamps the local listener to
  owner-only after saved settings/environment and removes its response allowlist.
  This includes the runner's verified same-owner agent semantics. It does not
  rewrite imported policy or saved records; remove the flag from both file and
  process to disable the clamp. Empty/`0`/`false` do not disable it.

Changing, adding or removing native inputs requires a **native rebuild and app
restart**; Cargo tracks the file and all three process keys, including removal.
Running agents are not hot-reconfigured. Explicit empty process values clear the
provider or environment floor; boolean capabilities must be absent to disable.
Runtime resources remain separately built from pinned sources with private build
settings stripped. The app-owned relay/key/OAuth boundaries are unchanged:
`BUZZ_RELAY_URL` is not an agent destination, saved destinations remain explicit,
and `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` still conflicts with app-isolated persistent OAuth.

See [configuration parity](configuration.md) for development routing, release
flag exclusions and the supported deployment boundary.

## Harnesses and agent defaults

Individual-agent configuration stays on the Agents page; Settings → Agents owns
installation guidance and device-wide defaults.

### Harnesses

The **Harnesses** card always lists the Tier 1 options **Buzz Agent**, **Goose**,
and **Pi**. **Add harness** opens the Tier 2 Hermes chooser and setup details.
Hermes also appears in the main list once its executable is detected:

- **Buzz Agent** is bundled and shows **Ready**.
- **Goose** is bundled and always shows **Ready**. Buzz launches `goose-acp`
  directly, with no CLI installation or ACP subcommand. Provider credentials
  and inference readiness remain separate from executable availability.
  Buzz Agent remains the default; existing selections are preserved.
- **Pi** shows **Ready**, **CLI needed**, or **Adapter needed**. On macOS/Linux,
  **Install** downloads checksum-verified Node v24.18.0 into app-data, then uses
  that Node/npm to install Pi and `buzz-pi-acp` into an app-owned npm prefix.
  Installation has a private log, re-detects the executables, and restarts only
  enabled Pi agents that previously failed because their executable was missing.
  User-global Pi installations remain untouched. Windows and unsupported
  architectures retain manual setup. Settings explains that **Install** supplies
  Node.js, Pi, and the adapter automatically. Copyable terminal commands are
  collapsed under **Manual setup** within the Pi row (Node.js 22.19 or newer required).
  Failed installs show the failed step and a bounded npm error excerpt above
  the expandable private install log; errors do not assume a registry problem.
  The manual fallback commands are:

  ```sh
  npm install -g '@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@>=0.99.0'
  npm install -g --install-links=true 'git+https://github.com/salman1993/buzz-pi-acp.git#72015de'
  ```

- **Hermes Agent** shows **Ready** or **CLI needed** in **Add harness**, with a
  manual setup guide and no Install/Update action. **Check again** updates the
  chooser and main list; removing its executable hides the main row again.
  Discovery searches for the exact `hermes-acp` launcher name. Windows `.exe`/`.cmd`/`.bat` launchers are a known discovery
  limitation in this slice; saved absolute paths remain recognizable/editable.

Tier 2 definitions live in [`harness-presets.json`](../crates/agent-controller/src/harness-presets.json),
owned by the controller and read by both Rust and TypeScript. Native discovery
reports executable presence and editing suggestions through `harnessOptions`.
Settings and create/edit identify presets by executable name using the shared
JSON; setup metadata is not duplicated in IPC. Frontend lookup preserves
saved-path identity on older hosts and does not infer installation.
All presets currently use the harness's own model/provider defaults. Runtime
quirks remain in the pinned `buzz-acp`; Goose and Pi retain their specialized
setup and model integrations. Adding a preset definition still requires a real
ACP compatibility check; this registry does not implement model browsing.

**Check again** re-detects installed Harnesses without reopening Buzz. Status
is executable detection, not a guarantee of sign-in, ACP readiness or inference.
The reviewed Pi adapter revision supports native steering, which needs Pi 0.99.0
or later. Buzz checks the selected Pi CLI's version before agent startup or
model browsing. An older or unreadable version fails with an error naming the
selected CLI path and the required update. Verification has a five-second limit
and receives only basic system environment values, never inherited Buzz or
provider credentials. Model Cancel retires the probe and its helpers; probing
runs outside the agent controller lock so Stop and status remain available.
Start rechecks its ticket and effective Pi settings after verification.

Each app-owned install goes into a new release under
`node-tools/releases/<adapter revision>.<time>`. Buzz then renames the `pi` and
`buzz-pi-acp` shims in `node-tools/bin` to point at it, so an agent that starts
during an update never sees a partial install. Buzz keeps the previous release
for agents still running from it. When the shims point at a release of an older
adapter revision, a Ready app-owned Pi offers **Update Pi**, which installs Pi
and the pinned adapter together. Settings shows no update guidance for a ready
user-global installation. To update one at `<prefix>/bin/buzz-pi-acp`, rerun both
commands above with `--prefix <prefix>` so npm updates that copy even when the
active npm uses another global prefix. Restart running Pi agents after either
update so new sessions load it.
Add/Edit links to Settings → Agents for setup instead of telling people to reopen
the app. The ACP tooltip says:

> Buzz talks to harnesses through the Agent Client Protocol (ACP). Goose ships with Buzz. Pi needs the buzz-pi-acp adapter. Hermes Agent uses its own ACP launcher and sign-in.

### Global agent defaults and saving

The **Agent defaults** card in Settings → Agents holds a default harness,
provider, model, effort and environment variables.

- The default harness is **copied into each new agent** at creation (Create
  falls back to Buzz Agent while the default harness is not installed). Changing
  it later does not switch existing agents.
- Provider, model and effort are **looked up at each start** for fields an agent
  leaves blank, only when the agent uses the default harness; per-agent values
  win. The editor shows a blank field as “Use agent defaults (…)”. Effort has no
  per-agent field: an imported agent's `effort_level` stays its override.
- Permitted environment variables merge **per key**; the agent's key wins.
  `BUZZ_ACP_MODEL` inherits only within the default harness, while shared controls
  such as worker count and system prompt can inherit across Pi and Goose.
  A saved Databricks workspace/filter also wins over the corresponding
  global `DATABRICKS_HOST` / `DATABRICKS_MODEL_FILTER` pair. Agents without their
  own workspace/filter inherit the global pair.
- Changing the default harness in the card clears the default model and effort;
  values entered for the new harness before Save are kept.
- The effort picker offers common values for the selected harness and keeps
  custom values editable; support still depends on the selected model. Known Pi
  and Goose providers show the same masked API key field as agent Create/Edit.
  A key entered there is a write-only
  global environment override, used by model lookup and inherited by agents
  without their own key. Switching provider or harness drops an unsaved key.
- Model choices include exact IDs. Catalogs over ten models have a local search
  by name or ID; filtering does not change the selection. Environment removals
  must be saved before browsing because lookup still inherits saved values.

The store is `defaults.json` under app-data `agent-controller/`, not
localStorage, written atomically with owner-only permissions (0600).
Environment values are write-only, like per-agent API keys: only key names are
returned to the UI. This layer applies before
[`BuildDefaults::resolve()`](../crates/agent-controller/src/defaults.rs), so a
global value wins over the [nonsecret build floor](#nonsecret-build-defaults),
which still fills only Buzz Agent blanks. Goose and Pi receive inherited
provider/model through their existing selectors. Inherited values are never
written into saved agents.

Saving an agent or the defaults restarts, through the native supervisor, only
agents that were **running** before and after the save and whose **effective**
launch settings changed. Stopped and disabled agents are never started or
enabled; a Stop that lands before the restart wins. Save reports “Saved.” or
“Saved. Restarted N agents.” `restartDiff` compares effective settings, so it
also flags inherited changes. Both requested updates and ordinary agent edits close after a complete save and show the result in a toast. Save errors, restart failures, and unconfirmed profile publication keep the editor open for recovery.

## Avatar editing

Edit uses the same draft avatar picker as human Profile settings: upload/drop an
image, paste an HTTPS URL, choose emoji artwork, or remove the picture. Done changes
the form; Save first persists the exact native ID/revision, then publishes to that
agent's saved community without restarting it. Older native hosts without
`avatarEditingAvailable` retain the display-only avatar.

An omitted picture preserves the saved override; an empty string explicitly removes
it. A changed picture durably marks `profilePending`, so closing/reloading does not
lose the Retry action. The native publisher reads and verifies the agent's current
signed kind-0 profile, changes only picture, and preserves unrelated content and
non-auth tags. Name/bot initialization is only for a missing profile. A local
configuration rename is not an implicit published-profile rename.

One native publication per agent can run at a time, including across renderer
reloads. The host verifies current-profile readback after a matching accepted
receipt before clearing pending at the same saved revision. Conflicting or failed
reads/publications keep pending for explicit retry; no automatic broadcast or
retry loop is introduced. Another client can still replace the profile after this
confirmation; this is not a cross-client transaction.

Browser tests use synthetic profiles/media and controller fixtures. Rust checks
use temporary stores, public fixture keys and loopback HTTP. They do not establish
live relay access, native image rendering or packaged human signing. Camera and
recording are outside this avatar slice.

## Agent Keychain unlock (macOS)

Managed agent keys share one agent-only Keychain item: service
`dev.local.buzz.foundation.agents`, account `agent-bundle-v1`. After a successful
read, the native credential owner caches it for the session; starting another
migrated agent does not read another Keychain item. Human identity and old Buzz's
credential blob stay separate. Nothing collects the macOS password or changes
Keychain access controls. Development signing and other credentials can still
cause OS prompts; this is not a promise of exactly one total dialog.

Existing app-owned `agent:<key-community>` entries are copied lazily on Start or
other explicit credential use, with exact identity validation and secure readback.
The first migration can require multiple approvals. Original entries remain for
rollback; explicit Delete removes both copies before removing settings. New keys
are written only to the bundle, so older versions cannot start newly created keys.
Do not operate older and newer credential writers concurrently during rollback.
Never delete old Buzz's source credentials for this migration.

A short per-OS-user file lock serializes bundle access across cooperating
worktrees/profiles. Writes re-read the current bundle under that lock and verify
readback; a nonsecret invalidation token in the lock file invalidates other
sessions' cached copies before writes. Lock files contain no keys. Busy storage
fails visibly and requires explicit Retry; it never waits behind another app's
consent prompt or automatically replays a write. This does not coordinate manual
Keychain edits or older app versions; quit the app before changing storage outside
this owner. A refused unlock is remembered until explicit Start/Retry, Import,
Create, profile publication, or Delete; later auto-start rows do not reopen it.

All launch-selected agents appear **Waiting to start · unlock Keychain if prompted**
until their turn finishes acquiring credentials. A successful acquisition advances
to **Starting process**, then process-alive evidence or a specific failure with
**Retry start**. Stop remains available while waiting; pending OS dialogs may
still need dismissal, but a late result cannot start a stopped agent. Quit and
saved-revision fences remain in force. No frontend polling automatically retries
Start. Windows/Linux retain their existing per-agent credential adapter.

### Development startup diagnostics

Debug builds print `[agent-startup]` and `[agent-keychain]` lines to the existing
`just desktop` terminal. Selection records include the public key/community ID,
effective `startOnAppLaunch` and enabled intent, then each auto-start attempt records its
final process state. Credential records identify bundle/individual/legacy item
class, operation, begin/end, sanitized failure category and elapsed time. They
never print keys, raw item accounts, relay URLs, environment, agent names or OS
error text. Release builds do not emit these diagnostics; no new log store or
telemetry transport is added. A Keychain API call is not proof of an OS prompt.

For an attended check, retain only these prefixed lines locally, note the dialog's
item label (never the password), then quit and relaunch the **unchanged binary**.
Do not manually start agents or send waking mentions during this check: credential
lines have no agent ID, so overlapping credential operations cannot be attributed
by order. Already-migrated agents should use the bundle, not individual reads. Native
signing/OS consent remains a separate observation; do not equate a fixture pass
or a Keychain call count with password-dialog acceptance. Auto-start off is a
saved preference, not an execution failure: change **Start on launch** in the
agent profile's Runtime tab deliberately rather than rewriting settings.

## Runtime boundary

Native startup opens `app_data_dir/agent-controller`, never the old library as a
destination. One serialized controller lives for the app lifetime. It restores
agents whose start-on-launch preference is on (legacy records without one follow
saved enabled intent) with app-owned credential custody and verified resources.
Page/plugin/community disposal drops observations, not processes. Quit fences
pending starts and stops owned processes while retaining enabled intent. A pending
OS credential dialog does not hold the controller: Stop, Disconnect and Quit
retire late starts; Save during a credential wait requires an explicit retry.
Synthetic native tests inject rejecting or in-memory credentials and runtime
resources. Production has no disposable storage override or preview launch mode.

Launch-selected agents start relay listeners; their AI worker pools remain lazy
until work arrives. Status reads project configured ACP/MCP paths without reading
or hashing executables. These paths and `runtimeAvailable` describe the bundle
accepted at initialization, not a fresh integrity check or relay readiness. Every
actual launch still verifies its bundled worker, ACP and MCP executables before
spawn, and exposes verification failure on the agent. Native Start projects one
final snapshot after recording its outcome. This adds no incoming wake service
for fully stopped listeners and no durable interrupted-turn recovery.

An execed supervisor in the same app binary owns each agent's shared
identity lock, isolated listener session, and temporary runtime directory. App
Stop/Quit and kernel EOF on forced app death both trigger the existing whole-session
teardown; ownership is released only after listener and workers have exited.
Unconfirmed teardown keeps the lock and private directory, and normal Quit remains
fail-closed. This does not clean up listeners orphaned before this fix, does not
contain a worker that deliberately escapes its session, and force-killing the
supervisor itself releases ownership without confirmed teardown.

On Windows the session is a kill-on-close job object. The listener starts
suspended and runs only after joining it; a failed assignment aborts Start. A
watcher opens each process as it joins. Stop terminates the job immediately,
without Unix's two-second cooperative cancel, and succeeds only once every process
the job ever admitted was opened and has exited. A lost job notification, or a
process gone before the watcher opened it, fails Stop closed and keeps ownership.
The windowless supervisor can still
be ended by an enclosing kill-on-close launcher job. Profile, config and temporary
directories inherit Windows ACLs; they are not verified to match Unix 0700/0600 modes.

Non-Pi harnesses get the bundled tools first on PATH, then Windows' native PATH;
on Linux `~/.local/bin` and `/usr/local/bin` precede the system directories, which
are macOS's only entries. On Windows the shell tool needs Git Bash from Git for
Windows, or a `BUZZ_SHELL`/`GIT_BASH` override under Advanced → Environment.
Settings says **Shell setup not verified**; Buzz does not check it before Start.

## Ownership and handoff

- `features/agents/control.ts`: camelCase DTOs and app-owned observable projection.
  `control-service.ts` constructs it once at root app composition and exposes its
  `AgentControl` interface through Cordis injection. Only the app disposes the projection;
  the author contract exposes neither its disposal nor host construction.
- `control-native.ts`: named native IPC commands, including explicit model-request tickets. Browser returns an
  unavailable capability; no fetch fallback, local storage, signing or runner.
- `bundled/agents/AgentControlPanel.tsx`: compose with `{ control }` independently
  of selected community or relay connectivity. It owns only observation and UI
  drafts. Its five-second status refresh runs while visible, including after a
  read or operation error; reads coalesce and never replay writes. A read
  rejected specifically because native startup is initializing or its lock is busy
  stays pending for at most twenty 250ms waits. Other errors or exhausted retries
  remain visible above the cards, with explicit Retry as well as the next periodic
  read. Successful reads clear the global warning; native per-agent errors remain
  on the affected agent, and failed Save/Create/Delete details stay in their dialog.
  Unmount clears the timer, not enabled intent or processes.
- Native host owns persistent state, credential custody, process groups, lock and
  duplicate ownership checks, source import validation and sanitized diagnostics.
  Critical sections wait in arrival order through the host's async admission gate
  and execute on blocking workers; a status read does not reject a concurrent
  command as busy. The worker retains admission until it finishes, even if its
  caller disappears. Credential and network waits release admission so recovery
  Stop can still invalidate pending launches. Shutdown is checked again after
  acquiring native state. Failed commands are never automatically replayed.
  It must bound IPC operations and reject with deliberately user-facing strings;
  raw child/OS/parser errors must never cross into these snapshots or rejections.

## User contract

- Start enables host-owned execution; Stop disables automatic resume and stops active
  work. A later deliberate outgoing mention can enable execution again. Native confirmation, not React optimism, determines displayed state.
  App Quit stops owned processes but retains enabled intent for the next launch.
- Start on launch is a separate persisted preference set with
  `agent_control_start_on_app_launch`. It is not a config revision and never
  starts or stops the running process; a restore it triggers is an ordinary Start.
  Created and imported agents save it off; only legacy records without one follow
  enabled intent. A launch restore queued behind another agent's credential
  prompt skips any agent explicitly started or stopped since the app opened.
- While a process is alive, `restartDiff` itemizes saved settings that differ from
  the settings it was started with. The native side compares raw values and sends
  only redacted entries: prompt character counts, masked arguments and environment
  values, and environment keys as added/removed.
- `running` is **process-alive evidence only**, labeled “Process running · relay
  readiness unverified.” It is not a Listening/Working badge or proof a mention
  can be received. Native wake/readiness acceptance is separate.
  The avatar badge is relay presence, which the harness publishes just after
  the process starts; the card re-reads it briefly after start/stop (see
  [presence](presence.md#ownership-and-bounds)).
- Save uses `expectedRevision` and updates only editable fields, then restarts
  running agents whose effective settings changed (see
  [Global agent defaults and saving](#global-agent-defaults-and-saving)).
  Saved/running revisions remain distinct. Dirty drafts survive refresh and save
  failure. A newer saved revision blocks overwrite and offers explicit discard;
  the person can copy their edits before discarding. Drafts are page-local and
  are not persisted across navigation/reload.
- Arguments use a JSON string array rather than splitting shell text, preserving
  spaces and literal quoting. Empty/comma-containing arguments are rejected because
  the current ACP transport cannot represent them faithfully. The executable is a per-agent
  harness choice; Settings → Agents owns the Harnesses setup card. The
  host must validate launch configuration and unsupported imported semantics
  before execution.
- Harness and Provider choices come from native `harnessOptions` through the
  injected Core snapshot. Buzz Agent offers Databricks v2 and OpenAI; Windows
  offers only OpenAI, which a new agent without a default uses, and explains an
  inherited or saved Databricks provider as unsupported. OpenAI
  uses the masked key field below as `OPENAI_COMPAT_API_KEY`, per agent or from
  Agent defaults. Goose is one logical harness choice, resolved to the verified
  bundled `goose-acp` executable, and offers common Goose providers plus a custom
  ID. Switching into Goose supplies no subcommand arguments and clears the
  previous provider/model; selecting a Goose provider clears the
  previous model. For Goose, an explicit Browse asks Goose ACP for the selected
  provider's supported-model list and searches it in the existing picker. The
  exact returned ID is saved; an unlisted ID remains possible but is flagged
  after discovery. The picker shows at most ten matches while filtering the full
  list. Saved write-only `GOOSE_PROVIDER` overrides remain native; native uses
  the effective provider before asking Goose. Goose has no separate Refresh
  action because its catalog lookup can start OAuth. Known API-key providers
  show a masked key field beside Provider. Its write-only environment patch is
  used for both model lookup and agent launch; a blank field uses Goose's
  existing credentials. The key field follows a draft `GOOSE_PROVIDER` override.
  When a saved override's value is hidden, Buzz asks the user to replace or
  remove it in Advanced → Environment before showing a provider-specific key
  field. These per-agent keys are stored in the app's local
  `agents.json` settings file and its backup with restricted filesystem
  permissions, not in Goose's keyring. Listing errors prompt the user to enter credentials or retry;
  manual model entry remains available. Executable detection
  is not a sign-in or ACP readiness check. Custom command/provider values remain
  editable, including absolute paths. Buzz Agent retains on-demand Databricks
  model browsing. A Goose catalog entry does not establish caller EXECUTE permission
  or successful inference. Advanced arguments remain a literal JSON array. Old native hosts
  without this metadata fall back to custom entry.
- For Goose and Pi, **Test connection** appears below the provider/API key and
  above Model, including before a model is chosen. The shared form and native
  request lane own cancellation and result display; tests never fill Model.
- For Goose, a blank Model resolves the selected provider's `defaultModel`
  through Goose ACP provider metadata. Buzz keeps no default-model mapping.
  A nonblank explicit model or effective `GOOSE_MODEL` override is tested as entered.
  **Test connection** sends one small request in the agent workspace using the
  effective draft provider, model, and write-only environment. Goose keeps its
  own output and thinking defaults.
  Bundled `goose-acp` uses a hidden temporary session in chat mode with extensions
  disabled. Buzz checks its recorded conversation for a nonempty assistant reply
  and rejects error content: ACP can render provider errors and empty token-limit
  fallbacks as ordinary text notifications. Buzz then deletes only that temporary
  session before returning, including on inference failure or timeout. Cancellation
  schedules bounded cleanup, also handling an in-flight session creation. If deletion
  fails, Buzz reports that the session may remain in Goose history; a crash or
  unresponsive sidecar can interrupt cleanup. The test consumes a small amount of
  provider quota.
  An external full Goose CLI pin retains `goose run --text --no-session --no-profile`
  without saving a session. Success requires nonempty assistant text and reported
  token usage in its JSON output; Goose can exit successfully with synthetic text
  after a provider error. Providers that omit usage cannot confirm success through
  this CLI check. Model browsing does not create a session or fall back to the CLI.
  Neither check verifies Buzz relay readiness, launches the agent, or changes the
  draft. Success reports the canonical provider/model tested, except that write-only
  overrides keep their values hidden. A provider without a default asks for a model;
  Buzz never substitutes another provider.
- For Pi, with Model blank, Pi chooses from
  the selected provider's `--models provider/*` scope. Buzz checks Pi's actual
  selection through RPC before sending a short prompt; if Pi falls back to
  another provider, Buzz stops and asks for credentials. With a model selected,
  Buzz tests that exact provider/model. Success requires an assistant text reply
  and reports its canonical model ID without changing the draft. Listing models
  alone does not verify the API key or inference access. Tests use the agent's
  effective environment and existing Pi sign-in, create no saved Pi session,
  and stop on cancellation or timeout.

- Environment values never arrive in snapshots. Inputs are write-only patches:
  missing key preserves; string replaces (including empty); null removes.
  Draft `BUZZ_ACP_AGENTS` values are readable; other inputs stay masked.
  Undo omits a patch again. Successful save clears entered values from UI state.
  Browser strings cannot promise zeroization. Unknown native fields stay native.
  Saved `BUZZ_AGENT_MODEL`/`BUZZ_AGENT_PROVIDER` (buzz-agent) and
  `GOOSE_MODEL`/`GOOSE_PROVIDER` (Goose) overrides win over Model/Provider
  selectors; blank selectors do not erase them. ACP uses the same effective model.
  Snapshots name the deciding key (`launchModelEnv`/`launchProviderEnv`,
  including `DATABRICKS_MODEL` or a hidden provider behind a blank buzz-agent
  model) and omit the resolved value.
- Local browsing reads only the chosen installed/development library without a
  destination. Native keeps no pending import for that read and invalidates any
  prior import token. An actionable import preview requires an explicit secure
  **Destination community** origin. Old Buzz ignores saved relay
  pins at runtime; blank, stale or malformed saved pins do not route or hide
  identities here. Native validates the chosen destination, shows it beside each
  exact key, and retains it with the preview token through commit. Source or
  destination edits discard candidates and invalidate late preview results. Each
  Import action selects one exact identity. Duplicate source keys fail closed even with different
  old pins; changed sources and duplicate destination ownership are rejected.
  Only explicit Import actions commit, always stopped. No key minting, membership
  enrollment or source-store write. After a failed preview, correct the destination/source
  and choose **Load agents** or **Retry**; both refresh status before previewing.
  Never edit the old library to work around a destination error.
- Operations are serialized except explicit recovery Stop during a pending
  Start/Restart, Import, Create or profile-publication credential wait. Stop can
  reach the native fence for a pending launch or another known enabled/running
  identity; only one Stop is admitted at a time. Other writes remain blocked until
  both operations settle. Superseded success, error and finalization cannot
  overwrite the newer Stop result or unlock its pending operation. Stop does not
  cancel native credential writes: imported/created rows may still commit stopped,
  and profiles may publish. Recover these changes by a fresh status read, never by
  replaying the superseded result.
  Old pre-write reads cannot overwrite newer command evidence. Failed reads/commands retain the last snapshot
  and draft with explicit uncertainty. Start/Restart/Save/import require a fresh
  successful host read before retry. Explicit Stop is the only recovery exception:
  it remains available for identities in the retained snapshot, even if that stale
  snapshot says stopped/disabled. Failed durable disable remains unconfirmed;
  Stop is never automatically retried. No process recovery loop in TypeScript.

## Databricks connection and models

- Native `agent_models.rs` owns one ticketed, 180-second operation lane, separate
  from the controller lock. Only the user-intent Connect IPC action (Browse/Retry) can open a browser; it tries headless discovery first. Refresh is always headless.
  Cancel, context change, page unmount and root disposal retire the ticket. Native
  admission remains occupied until the old task's future has actually dropped.
- The immutable `buzz-agent` dependency is pinned in
  [`src-tauri/Cargo.toml`](../src-tauri/Cargo.toml); no local-checkout dependency. It owns
  OAuth PKCE, refresh, catalog parsing/filtering and per-page bounds. It retains current Buzz endpoint/redirect semantics. Native rejects over 10,000
  projected models or oversized IDs.
- OAuth credentials remain under this app's
  `agent-controller/buzz-agent/oauth/databricks/<connection-hash>.json`. Connect,
  native catalog, worker catalog and inference share this exact engine layout.
  Unix directories are owner-only; helper token files are owner-only. They are
  **not Keychain-encrypted**; other code running as your OS user can access them.
  Non-Unix helper persistence remains memory-only, so Windows refuses Databricks
  Connect, catalog, credential open and Start with an explicit unsupported error
  (OpenAI is unaffected). No old Buzz cache/Keychain or
  ambient `DATABRICKS_HOST`/`DATABRICKS_TOKEN` is read.
- Disconnect requires Stop for all owned workers using the displayed workspace,
  retires pending starts for it, and removes only its app cache (retaining the lock
  inode). It does not revoke browser sessions or tokens at Databricks. Cancel may happen
  after successful authentication; use Disconnect if credentials should be removed.
- Save persists workspace/filter with the harness revision; Connect does not save
  or start. Saved or draft environment overrides take precedence; conflicting inputs fail before
  auth rather than querying a misleading catalog. An effective non-v2 provider,
  token override or revision conflict also blocks connection. `BUZZ_AGENT_MODEL`
  produces a visible override warning, never leaks its value or rewrites it.
- Catalogs may be partial; no completeness claim. The pinned helper's labelled
  authenticated-empty defaults are omitted here because they are not discovered
  IDs. Empty/error states keep manual entry available.
- [Nonsecret build defaults](#nonsecret-build-defaults) supply the workspace,
  model fallback and filter without copying them into saved agents. Unknown or
  secret build keys fail closed. With no saved or build workspace, enter one
  explicitly before browsing models.

## Runtime resources

Ordinary `bin/just desktop` and `bin/pnpm tauri build` prepare these resources
automatically. Direct Cargo builds do not run that JavaScript preparation step.
To prepare/build without launching any app or accessing old credentials:

```sh
bin/pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
bin/node scripts/build-agent-runtime.mjs
bin/pnpm build
bin/cargo build -p buzz-foundation
```

[`runtime/agent-runtime.json`](../runtime/agent-runtime.json) pins five Buzz tools
to the same immutable source revision as the native library, plus an independent
Goose revision for `goose-acp`. The build script fetches both revisions and uses
pinned Cargo with locked dependencies: a release build of the Buzz tools and a
lean Goose build without default features. Builds happen outside the checkout,
scrub injected Buzz/provider environment and
per-shell compiler overrides (`RUSTFLAGS`, `RUSTC_*`, `CARGO_PROFILE_*`, …), and stages binaries plus
revision/Goose source and build settings/target/SHA256 manifest in
`src-tauri/resources/agent-runtime`. Worktrees
of one clone reuse a verified bundle cached under the Git common directory, keyed
by the pin, tool list, build arguments and `rustc -vV`. Native build copies them to
`target/debug/agent-runtime`. Generated binaries/manifest are not committed.
Startup verifies all six tools, target, both source pins, Goose build settings
and file hashes. Packaged
macOS apps may accept signing-induced hash changes only when the runtime belongs
to the running app and its resource seal verifies under Block's Developer ID.
The final hashes are retained in memory; required launch tools are rehashed before spawn. No PATH/old-bundle fallback or runtime
download. The manifest detects corrupt/mixed resources, not a same-user attacker
who can replace the app and manifest. Inputs are immutable, not a promise of
bit-identical machine-independent binaries. This build is not a signed installer.

### Updating the agent runtime

Update the library pin in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` and the bundle pin in
`runtime/agent-runtime.json` together, then refresh `Cargo.lock` without unrelated
dependency upgrades. The runtime integration test checks that both pins name the
same repository and immutable revision; the native synthetic manifest reads the
runtime spec rather than carrying another copy of the pin.

Goose upgrades change only the `goose` source/build settings in the runtime spec;
they do not require changing the Buzz library or tool revision. Logical
`goose` selections use the bundled sidecar, including saved legacy selections
with a leading `acp` argument. Explicit absolute paths remain external harness
pins and retain their launch arguments. Model browsing resolves the same verified
sidecar; it never searches PATH for a CLI.

Re-run the resource preparation and native build commands above, then validate:

```sh
bin/cargo test --locked -p buzz-foundation -p buzz-agent-controller -- --include-ignored
bin/node --test tests/integration/agent-runtime.test.mjs
```

These checks use isolated fixtures, including the staged binaries; they do not
launch the app or access live credentials. Exercise upstream behavior changes
with relevant bundled-tool smoke checks. Do not commit generated resources;
live handover remains a separate step below.

## Handover and rollback

1. While old Buzz still runs, review/import only. Choose the installed/development
   library and destination under **Import options**. Import may prompt for the
   selected legacy secure-storage blob; it creates app credentials in the separate agent-only bundle described above.
   The source
   is read-only and imported agents stay stopped. Refused custody is a blocker,
   never a reason to migrate keys implicitly.
2. Review prompt, workspace, harness/provider/model and write-only overrides.
   Browse models, save explicitly, and verify settings after reopening.
3. Before Start or an outgoing mention, stop old Buzz **and its listeners** with
   the human's agreement. Native refuses detected legacy paths; it never kills
   them. Cooperating new-app profiles also hold an exact-key/community OS lock.
   Neither protects against relaunching unmodified old Buzz: no coexistence claim.
4. Observe a real channel/thread reply, idle wake, Stop cancellation and Quit
   cleanup in the attended workflow. A process-running badge is not relay evidence.
5. Stop agents on a workspace before Disconnect. A saved host edit does not change
   a running worker. Temporary signing files under private `runs/agent-*` disappear
   only after confirmed teardown. This is lifecycle management, not a sandbox for
   same-user code that escapes its Unix session.
6. Roll back with Stop and confirmed new-owner cleanup, then Quit and resume that
   identity in old Buzz. Never delete the old library or its credentials.

## Validation and limits

`control.test.ts`, `control-native.test.ts`, `agent-edit.test.ts` cover projection
races, unavailable browser, exact IPC payloads, uncertain result handling,
save/restart feedback, literal arguments and environment patch
semantics.
`tests/browser/agent-control.spec.mjs` drives the real editor and capability over
the isolated fake host in Chromium/WebKit: dirty refresh, save failure, revisions,
write-only replacement, Stop, unmount without control actions, selected import,
browser unavailability and narrow dark layout. Mounted recovery cases start with
running and stopped snapshots, fail status reads, then exercise explicit Stop
through the real capability; failed durable disable retains uncertainty and drafts.
These browser fixtures do not prove native IPC or persistence.

`src/app/agent-control.integration.test.ts` exercises real app composition, Agents
registration, plugin management, community selection and the native adapter with
synthetic IPC/relay transports. The same injected capability remains functional
through disable/re-enable, two real community session switches and Personal space.
Captured IPC contains only snapshots during those transitions; root disposal fences
further reads without sending Stop. This is not a mounted native GUI test.
`src/plugins/author.test.mjs` builds declarations and independently compiles a plugin
consumer with no host source, checking Context injection and non-exported ownership.
`src-tauri/src/agents/tests.rs` uses the actual command handler and Tauri mock runtime
with temporary disk stores for Save/CAS/Stop, source preview, rejecting test credentials/runtime and
shutdown fencing. These checks do not establish secure custody, process teardown
or a working listener.

The isolated browser fixture (`tests/fixtures/agent-control.*`) remains test-only:
no dotenv loading, live broker, native credentials or actual process execution.
It supports the controller, editor-grid and model browser regression suites, not
an alternative product launch mode. Check results belong in the PR at their exact
snapshot rather than as permanent checkpoint claims here.

Local execution currently uses Unix containment; native credential import/create
is macOS-only. Custom harnesses require an absolute executable and are not
certified by bundled Buzz Agent tests. Unsupported settings stay editable but
Start refuses them. OAuth files are owner-only, not Keychain-encrypted. A failed
import can leave create-only app custody for retry but no enabled/configured agent.
No remote/mesh runtime, live team synchronization or conditional attestation is added. Synthetic checks
do not establish actual Keychain ACLs, production TLS/inference, live replies,
forced native quit, signed packaging or other-platform behavior.

## Pi harness

On macOS/Linux, Settings → Agents offers **Install** for a missing Pi CLI or
adapter. It uses an app-owned Node and npm prefix; manual setup still works.
Choose **Check again** to re-detect without reopening the app. Pi appears
alongside Buzz Agent and Goose.
Availability means the executables were found, not that authentication or
inference has been verified. This
integration uses the adapter's Pi argument forwarding after `--` (verified with
buzz-pi-acp 0.0.33) and Pi's `get_available_models` RPC (verified with Pi 0.86.1).

Choose **Pi → LLM Provider → Browse models**, or leave Provider unset and Browse
to see all locally available providers. The returned provider/model pair is saved
as separate fields; model IDs retain namespace slashes and punctuation. Browse
also adds extension-provided providers to the provider choices. Pi provider
changes filter the loaded catalog without launching another lookup. Workspace,
arguments or environment changes retire it and clear discovered provider suggestions. Custom provider
and model entry remain available, including when lookup fails or returns no models.
When a provider is set, enter its exact model ID without adding the provider prefix.
The Advanced model field preserves text literally, including IDs that themselves
start with the provider name. After Browse, an unlisted ID carries a warning;
manual IDs remain allowed and an available catalog is not inference validation.
Clear both fields to keep Pi's own defaults. Choosing a provider requires a model
before Start; Pi otherwise silently ignores a provider-only flag. Save restarts a
running Pi agent whose effective settings changed.

Discovery launches the same locally resolved Pi used by the ACP adapter, in the
agent's workspace, with the same explicit environment and extension arguments.
It uses `--mode rpc --no-session --no-themes` and sends only
`get_available_models`, never a prompt or Buzz identity. Selection is omitted
from catalog startup so a stale model cannot prevent finding its replacement.
Cancel, changed workspace/configuration, and closing the editor retire the native
lookup; Unix cleanup kills the lookup process group. Errors require explicit retry.
Pi may return a cached extension catalog; Refresh reloads Pi’s available snapshot
and does not guarantee a fresh remote catalog. The catalog reflects Pi's available models and local credentials, not a guarantee
of inference permission. Authentication and extension caches remain Pi-owned;
configure sign-in in Pi. Extensions are executable local code and can perform
their own initialization/authentication during discovery.

Runtime forwards Provider and Model as `--provider` / `--model` to the adapter
and uses `provider/exact-id` for ACP model selection. There are no invented Pi
provider/model environment variables. The controller owns `PI_ACP_PI_COMMAND`;
it resolves Pi and Node beside the adapter first, then the usual local install
locations. Ambient provider credentials are not inherited. Use Pi's credential
store or explicit write-only per-agent environment patches.

Optional extension configuration uses Pi's existing facilities, with no provider
package bundled into the OSS app:

- Install/configure packages in Pi normally; both discovery and runtime load them.
- Set `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` in Advanced environment to use a specific local Pi
  configuration directory. It is saved locally, never projected in a snapshot.
- To load a particular extension, set Advanced arguments to
  `["--", "--extension", "/absolute/path/to/extension.ts"]`. Paths containing spaces
  are supported. `--no-extensions` disables automatic extension discovery while
  keeping explicitly supplied extensions. Advanced runtime arguments are preserved
  and forwarded to the adapter, including
  thinking, skills and tools. Browse supports standard Pi configuration options
  and strips provider/model flags for catalog startup. Unsupported extension flags
  or positional input block Browse with an explanation, while manual entry and
  runtime arguments remain available. Browse also rejects inline `--flag=value`
  syntax and `--api-key`, whose meaning depends on the selected startup provider;
  use Pi's local credential store or explicit provider environment instead.
  The adapter still owns its reserved
  session, prompt and mode flags. Explicit Provider/Model fields are appended last.

Internal distributions can provision a pinned extension package and Pi config,
or supply an installed extension path through these same settings. Keep private
package URLs, hosts, filters, authentication and model policy in the private
packaging/configuration owner. Discovery and runtime must point at that same
configuration. The current internal release repository builds the old desktop;
its generic build environment injection is not a Pi resource-bundling contract
for this app. Signed bundling, automatic employee provisioning and release
pipeline migration require separate release work; no release is published here.

### Community setup confirmation

Local installation import validates the source configuration, owner authorization
and private key. It does not require relay inventory or a community confirmation.
The imported agent stays stopped.

For explicit setup in a community, the broker can sign the selected owner's
intent for an identity/community pair. Native code verifies that signature against
the retained source-owner authorization. This does not establish channel membership,
key availability or exclusive community membership. It does not reserve a community
before import. Setup recovery cannot add another community to an identity that
already has a configured setup elsewhere; copying that agent requires Clone.

Joined-community discovery reads each joined community's scoped inventory without
selecting it or opening a relay session. Exact keys appear once with all known
associations. Each failed community read has its own warning and Refresh retry;
successful reads remain visible. Discovery does not provide credentials, an import
source, or permission to extend an existing local identity into another community.

### Local inventory actions

Startup copies only identity names, public keys and source labels into a durable
inventory. It does not read keys, configure a setup, or start an imported agent.
Import copies the selected local key and settings, independent of relay inventory.
New imports require a destination and are saved configured but stopped.
**Use here** only recovers older incomplete imports. **Start** remains a separate
action; a later deliberate mention can also start a configured agent. Existing
saved setups without the configured flag keep their prior behavior.

The unified card's **Import** opens the existing installation form with its exact
identity and known local source selected. The source is fixed during review;
if the preview fails or the identity is unavailable there, you can choose
another source. **Clone**
from a local source or imported identity opens a review of only its name and
instructions; creation generates a fresh key. Clone never imports the old key.

Community groups show known associations, not exclusive membership or admission.
An inventory failure does not block local Import or setup confirmation. Every
configured setup keeps Start, Stop and Edit, whichever community is selected.
Cards for other communities also offer Clone to bring a new identity here,
without changing the source.
Archived discovery rows remain hidden after sources join, except where local
controls must remain reachable. Linked profiles remain visible on identity cards.

Before starting an imported identity, stop the old agent and disable its automatic
startup in the old application. Do not run duplicate copies of the same identity.
