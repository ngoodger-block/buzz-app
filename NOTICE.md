The relay read model in `src/features/relay` and development read broker in `dev`
are adapted from the supplied Astra example. The channel layout
and virtualizer behavior are adapted from that example's Channels view.

Astra's presentation is derived from Block Buzz `prototypes/project-cube-orbit`,
revision `0cd836965110adb18b95747c8656779c470d6e4d`:

The Apache-2.0 license is preserved in [LICENSE](LICENSE). Changes here
include Cordis service ownership, scoped channel panels, GitHub reference rendering,
connection lifecycle, stylesheet extraction and integration with the foundation.

App, favicon, and touch icons in `public/` and `src-tauri/icons/` are copied from
Block Buzz's `desktop/src-tauri/icons` ([source repository](https://github.com/block/buzz)).
The shell palette and proportions are adapted from the supplied Buzz screenshots.

`public/bestie.png` is the snake portrait supplied by the user for the shell.

`public/shell-gradient.png` is the background image supplied by Wes for the bento
shell on 2026-09-09 (SHA-256
`618ce821eaea22dd30bddb0c2a933284f0a49f6b4f0cefff5ae0b51e2b3ea651`).
The repeating dots are drawn in CSS, not baked into the image.

The Emoji Mart picker configuration and search-input focus/correction behavior in
`src/features/messages/emoji-mart.ts` are adapted from Block Buzz
`desktop/src/features/custom-emoji/ui/EmojiPicker.tsx` at revision
`b9392d9d78744df365f9276e1ffe8c1baa5ea903`. The adapter adds scoped custom IDs,
explicit dictionary cleanup, and lazy loading for the session-owned catalog.

## Harness brand marks

The Goose and Pi marks in `src/shared/design-system/icons/HarnessLogos.tsx`
are reused from old Buzz to identify their respective harnesses.

Goose: [block/goose](https://github.com/block/goose), revision
`305849b71709b95b86ed9f11bd3bc939899c0aab`,
`documentation/static/img/goose.svg`. Apache-2.0 © Block, Inc.; the license is
preserved in [LICENSE](LICENSE). Old Buzz changed the fill to `currentColor`
and removed the redundant clipping wrapper. This app adds the shared icon
sizing, ref and decorative accessibility gateway.

Pi: [earendil-works/pi-website](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-website),
revision `2f5e410b97474d0a34ec2500aa1aa58d6c3f992c`, `src/favicon.svg`.
The artwork is unchanged; this app adds the shared icon sizing, ref and
decorative accessibility gateway. Its license follows:
